He wished it had \nbeen later rather than sooner. \u201cMy mother told me that dead men sing no songs,\u201d he put \nin.\n\u201cMy wet nurse said the same thing, Will,\u201d Royce replied. \u201cNever believe anything you \nhear at a woman\u2019s tit. There are things to be learned even from the dead.\u201d His voice \nechoed, too loud in the twilit forest.\n\u201cWe have a long ride before us,\u201d Gared pointed out. \u201cEight days, maybe nine. And night \nis falling.\u201d\nSer Waymar Royce glanced at the sky with disinterest. \u201cIt does that every day about this \ntime. Are you unmanned by the dark, Gared?\u201d\nWill could see the tightness around Gared\u2019s mouth, the barely suppressed anger in his \neyes under the thick black hood of his cloak. Gared had spent forty years in the Night\u2019s \nWatch, man and boy, and he was not accustomed to being made light of. Yet it was more \nthan that. Under the wounded pride, Will could sense something else in the older man. \nYou could taste it; a nervous tension that came perilous close to fear.\nWill shared his unease. He had been four years on the Wall. The first time he had been \nsent beyond, all the old stories had come rushing back, and his bowels had turned to \nwater. He had laughed about it afterward.

Something was different tonight. There was an edge to this darkness that \nmade his hackles rise. Nine days they had been riding, north and northwest and then \nnorth again, farther and farther from the Wall, hard on the track of a band of wildling \nraiders. Each day had been worse than the day that had come before it. Today was the \nworst of all. A cold wind was blowing out of the north, and it made the trees rustle like \nliving things. All day, Will had felt as though something were watching him, something \ncold and implacable that loved him not. Gared had felt it too. Will wanted nothing so \nmuch as to ride hellbent for the safety of the Wall, but that was not a feeling to share \nwith your commander.\nEspecially not a commander like this one.\nSer Waymar Royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs. He \nwas a handsome youth of eighteen, grey-eyed and graceful and slender as a knife. \nMounted on his huge black destrier, the knight towered above Will and Gared on their \nsmaller garrons. He wore black leather boots, black woolen pants, black moleskin gloves, \nand a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of black wool and boiled \nleather. Ser Waymar had been a Sworn Brother of the Night\u2019s Watch for less than half a \nyear, but no one could say he had not prepared for his vocation. At least insofar as his \nwardrobe was concerned.\nHis cloak was his crowning glory; sable, thick and black and soft as sin. \u201cBet he killed \nthem all himself, he did,\u201d Gared told the barracks over wine, \u201ctwisted their little heads \noff, our mighty warrior.\u201d They had all shared the laugh.\nIt is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups, Will reflected as he sat \nshivering atop his garron. Gared must have felt the same.\n\u201cMormont said as we should track them, and we did,\u201d Gared said. \u201cThey\u2019re dead. They \nshan\u2019t trouble us no more. There\u2019s hard riding before us. I don\u2019t like this weather. If it \nsnows, we could be a fortnight getting back, and snow\u2019s the best we can hope for. Ever \nseen an ice storm, my lord?\u201d\nThe lordling seemed not to hear him. He studied the deepening twilight in that half-\nbored, half-distracted way he had. Will had ridden with the knight long enough to \nunderstand that it was best not to interrupt him when he looked like that. \u201cTell me again \nwhat you saw, Will. All the details.

He had included \nthe girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname \nSnow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to \nbe born with no name of their own.\nTheir father understood as well. \u201cYou want no pup for yourself, Jon?\u201d he asked softly.\n\u201cThe direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,\u201d Jon pointed out. \u201cI am no Stark, \nFather.\u201d\nTheir lord father regarded Jon thoughtfully.

It was a dark, primal place, three \nacres of old forest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around it. \nIt smelled of moist earth and decay. No redwoods grew here. This was a wood of \nstubborn sentinel trees armored in grey-green needles, of mighty oaks, of ironwoods as \nold as the realm itself. Here thick black trunks crowded close together while twisted \nbranches wove a dense canopy overhead and misshappen roots wrestled beneath the \nsoil. This was a place of deep silence and brooding shadows, and the gods who lived here \nhad no names.\nBut she knew she would find her husband here tonight.

She was of the Faith, like her father and grandfather and his \nfather before him. Her gods had names, and their faces were as familiar as the faces of \nher parents. Worship was a septon with a censer, the smell of incense, a seven-sided \ncrystal alive with light, voices raised in song. The Tullys kept a godswood, as all the great \nhouses did, but it was only a place to walk or read or lie in the sun. Worship was for the \nsept.\nFor her sake, Ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven faces of god, \nbut the blood of the First Men still flowed in the veins of the Starks, and his own gods \nwere the old ones, the nameless, faceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the \nvanished children of the forest.\nAt the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the \nwaters were black and cold. \u201cThe heart tree,\u201d Ned called it.

The Usurper\u2019s hired knives were close behind them, he insisted, though Dany \nhad never seen one.\nAt first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the \nlast Targaryens to their homes and tables, but as the years passed and the Usurper \ncontinued to sit upon the Iron Throne, doors closed and their lives grew meaner. Years \npast they had been forced to sell their last few treasures, and now even the coin they had \ngotten from Mother\u2019s crown had gone. In the alleys and wine sinks of Pentos, they called \nher brother \u201cthe beggar king.\u201d Dany did not want to know what they called her.\n\u201cWe will have it all back someday, sweet sister,\u201d he would promise her. Sometimes his \nhands shook when he talked about it. \u201cThe jewels and the silks, Dragonstone and King\u2019s \nLanding, the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms, all they have taken from us, we will \nhave it back.\u201d Viserys lived for that day.

Illyrio\u2019s servants entered, bowed, and set about their business. They were \nslaves, a gift from one of the magister\u2019s many Dothraki friends. There was no slavery in \nthe free city of Pentos. Nonetheless, they were slaves. The old woman, small and grey as \na mouse, never said a word, but the girl made up for it. She was Illyrio\u2019s favorite, a fair-\nhaired, blue-eyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as she worked.\nThey filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented it with \nfragrant oils. The girl pulled the rough cotton tunic over Dany\u2019s head and helped her into \nthe tub. The water was scalding hot, but Daenerys did not flinch or cry out. She liked the \nheat. It made her feel clean. Besides, her brother had often told her that it was never too \nhot for a Targaryen. \u201cOurs is the house of the dragon,\u201d he would say. \u201cThe fire is in our \nblood.\u201d\nThe old woman washed her long, silver-pale hair and gently combed out the snags, all in \nsilence. The girl scrubbed her back and her feet and told her how lucky she was. \u201cDrogo \nis so rich that even his slaves wear golden collars. A hundred thousand men ride in his \nkhalasar, and his palace in Vaes Dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid \nsilver.\u201d There was more like that, so much more, what a handsome man the khal was, so \ntall and fierce, fearless in battle, the best rider ever to mount a horse, a demon archer. \nDaenerys said nothing. She had always assumed that she would wed Viserys when she \ncame of age. For centuries the Targaryens had married brother to sister, since Aegon the \nConqueror had taken his sisters to bride. The line must be kept pure, Viserys had told \nher a thousand times; theirs was the kingsblood, the golden blood of old Valyria, the \nblood of the dragon. Dragons did not mate with the beasts of the field, and Targaryens \ndid not mingle their blood with that of lesser men. Yet now Viserys schemed to sell her \nto a stranger, a barbarian.\nWhen she was clean, the slaves helped her from the water and toweled her dry. The girl \nbrushed her hair until it shone like molten silver, while the old woman anointed her with \nthe spiceflower perfume of the Dothraki plains, a dab on each wrist, behind her ears, on \nthe tips of her breasts, and one last one, cool on her lips, down there between her legs. \nThey dressed her in the wisps that Magister Illyrio had sent up, and then the gown, a \ndeep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes. The girl slid the gilded sandals onto her \nfeet, while the old woman fixed the tiara in her hair, and slid golden bracelets crusted \nwith amethysts around her wrists.

Anxiously, she turned and looked at the man \nViserys hoped would ask to wed her before the night was done.\nThe slave girl had not been far wrong, she thought. Khal Drogo was a head taller than \nthe tallest man in the room, yet somehow light on his feet, as graceful as the panther in \nIllyrio\u2019s menagerie. He was younger than she\u2019d thought, no more than thirty.

Khal Drogo has never \nlost a fight. He is Aegon the Dragonlord come again, and you will be his queen.\u201d\nDany looked at Khal Drogo. His face was hard and cruel, his eyes as cold and dark as \nonyx. Her brother hurt her sometimes, when she woke the dragon, but he did not \nfrighten her the way this man frightened her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be his queen,\u201d she heard \nherself say in a small, thin voice. \u201cPlease, please, Viserys, I don\u2019t want to, I want to go", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2491, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "574c0680-dae9-4845-8997-b74b798d00f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "574c0680-dae9-4845-8997-b74b798d00f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a0e038f1-6ba1-41b6-b42f-6a5a7d3f9f1e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "hash": "cbd0d7fbdbc4da7ef3fb84c72efa4722d5bd0fcc74763699d0f464a836ac54a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "home.\u201d\n\u201cHome?\u201d He kept his voice low, but she could hear the fury in his tone. \u201cHow are we to \ngo home, sweet sister?

Over their heads a dozen golden banners whipped back and forth in the \nnorthern wind, emblazoned with the crowned stag of Baratheon.\nNed knew many of the riders. There came Ser Jaime Lannister with hair as bright as \nbeaten gold, and there Sandor Clegane with his terrible burned face. The tall boy beside \nhim could only be the crown prince, and that stunted little man behind them was surely \nthe Imp, Tyrion Lannister.\nYet the huge man at the head of the column, flanked by two knights in the snow-white \ncloaks of the Kingsguard, seemed almost a stranger to Ned . . . until he vaulted off the \nback of his warhorse with a familiar roar, and crushed him in a bone-crunching hug. \n\u201cNed! Ah, but it is good to see that frozen face of yours.\u201d The king looked him over top to \nbottom, and laughed. \u201cYou have not changed at all.\u201d\nWould that Ned had been able to say the same. Fifteen years past, when they had ridden \nforth to win a throne, the Lord of Storm\u2019s End had been clean-shaven, clear-eyed, and \nmuscled like a maiden\u2019s fantasy. Six and a half feet tall, he towered over lesser men, and \nwhen he donned his armor and the great antlered helmet of his House, he became a \nveritable giant. He\u2019d had a giant\u2019s strength too, his weapon of choice a spiked iron \nwarhammer that Ned could scarcely lift. In those days, the smell of leather and blood \nhad clung to him like perfume.\nNow it was perfume that clung to him like perfume, and he had a girth to match his \nheight. Ned had last seen the king nine years before during Balon Greyjoy\u2019s rebellion, \nwhen the stag and the direwolf had joined to end the pretensions of the self-proclaimed \nKing of the Iron Islands. Since the night they had stood side by side in Greyjoy\u2019s fallen \nstronghold, where Robert had accepted the rebel lord\u2019s surrender and Ned had taken his \nson Theon as hostage and ward, the king had gained at least eight stone. A beard as \ncoarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the \nroyal jowls, but nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes.\nYet Robert was Ned\u2019s king now, and not just a friend, so he said only, \u201cYour Grace. \nWinterfell is yours.\u201d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2414, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d049b439-e6a0-465f-a147-7e7decbd3d19": {"__data__": {"id_": "d049b439-e6a0-465f-a147-7e7decbd3d19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ac7c14c8-ba15-44d0-8eda-054912043ce2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "hash": "cf7feea14976e23ddf3bd75436259e8e0600426a8e7a7df1766ce81358edd049", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "By then the others were dismounting as well, and grooms were coming forward for their \nmounts.

Ned knelt in the snow to kiss the queen\u2019s ring, while Robert embraced \nCatelyn like a long-lost sister. Then the children had been brought forward, introduced, \nand approved of by both sides.\nNo sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to his \nhost, \u201cTake me down to your crypt, Eddard.

They swim naked in the river, right beneath the castle.

That was not a charge anyone could lay at the door of Eddard Stark. \nYet Ned could not help but notice that those pleasures were taking a toll on the king. \nRobert was breathing heavily by the time they reached the bottom of the stairs, his face \nred in the lantern light as they stepped out into the darkness of the crypt.\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Ned said respectfully. He swept the lantern in a wide semicircle. Shadows \nmoved and lurched. Flickering light touched the stones underfoot and brushed against a \nlong procession of granite pillars that marched ahead, two by two, into the dark. \nBetween the pillars, the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls, backs against \nthe sepulchres that contained their mortal remains. \u201cShe is down at the end, with Father \nand Brandon.\u201d\nHe led the way between the pillars and Robert followed wordlessly, shivering in the \nsubterranean chill. It was always cold down here. Their footsteps rang off the stones and \nechoed in the vault overhead as they walked among the dead of House Stark. The Lords \nof Winterfell watched them pass. Their likenesses were carved into the stones that sealed \nthe tombs. In long rows they sat, blind eyes staring out into eternal darkness, while great \nstone direwolves curled round their feet. The shifting shadows made the stone figures \nseem to stir as the living passed by.\nBy ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been \nLord of Winterfell, to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts.

The \nsweet, fruity taste of summerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips.\nThe Great Hall of Winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell of roasted \nmeat and fresh-baked bread. Its grey stone walls were draped with banners. White, gold, \ncrimson: the direwolf of Stark, Baratheon\u2019s crowned stag, the lion of Lannister. A singer \nwas playing the high harp and reciting a ballad, but down at this end of the hall his voice \ncould scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire, the clangor of pewter plates and cups, \nand the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations.\nIt was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king. Jon\u2019s brothers and sisters \nhad been seated with the royal children, beneath the raised platform where Lord and \nLady Stark hosted the king and queen. In honor of the occasion, his lord father would \ndoubtless permit each child a glass of wine, but no more than that. Down here on the \nbenches, there was no one to stop Jon drinking as much as he had a thirst for.\nAnd he was finding that he had a man\u2019s thirst, to the raucous delight of the youths \naround him, who urged him on every time he drained a glass. They were fine company, \nand Jon relished the stories they were telling, tales of battle and bedding and the hunt. \nHe was certain that his companions were more entertaining than the king\u2019s offspring. \nHe had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their entrance. The \nprocession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on the bench, and Jon \nhad gotten a good long look at them all.\nHis lord father had come first, escorting the queen. She was as beautiful as men said. A \njeweled tiara gleamed amidst her long golden hair, its emeralds a perfect match for the \ngreen of her eyes. His father helped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat, \nbut the queen never so much as looked at him.

His father had talked of him often: the peerless Robert \nBaratheon, demon of the Trident, the fiercest warrior of the realm, a giant among \nprinces. Jon saw only a fat man, red-faced under his beard, sweating through his silks. \nHe walked like a man half in his cups.\nAfter them came the children. Little Rickon first, managing the long walk with all the \ndignity a three-year-old could muster. Jon had to urge him on when he stopped to visit. \nClose behind came Robb, in grey wool trimmed with white, the Stark colors. He had the \nPrincess Myrcella on his arm. She was a wisp of a girl, not quite eight, her hair a cascade \nof golden curls under a jeweled net. Jon noticed the shy looks she gave Robb as they \npassed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him. He decided she was \ninsipid. Robb didn\u2019t even have the sense to realize how stupid she was; he was grinning \nlike a fool.\nHis half sisters escorted the royal princes. Arya was paired with plump young Tommen, \nwhose white-blond hair was longer than hers. Sansa, two years older, drew the crown \nprince, Joffrey Baratheon. He was twelve, younger than Jon or Robb, but taller than \neither, to Jon\u2019s vast dismay. Prince Joffrey had his sister\u2019s hair and his mother\u2019s deep \ngreen eyes. A thick tangle of blond curls dripped down past his golden choker and high \nvelvet collar. Sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him, but Jon did not like \nJoffrey\u2019s pouty lips or the bored, disdainful way he looked at Winterfell\u2019s Great Hall.\nHe was more interested in the pair that came behind him: the queen\u2019s brothers, the \nLannisters of Casterly Rock. The Lion and the Imp; there was no mistaking which was \nwhich. Ser Jaime Lannister was twin to Queen Cersei; tall and golden, with flashing \ngreen eyes and a smile that cut like a knife. He wore crimson silk, high black boots, a \nblack satin cloak. On the breast of his tunic, the lion of his House was embroidered in \ngold thread, roaring its defiance. They called him the Lion of Lannister to his face and \nwhispered \u201cKingslayer\u201d behind his back.\nJon found it hard to look away from him. This is what a king should look like, he \nthought to himself as the man passed.\nThen he saw the other one, waddling along half-hidden by his brother\u2019s side. Tyrion \nLannister, the youngest of Lord Tywin\u2019s brood and by far the ugliest. All that the gods \nhad given to Cersei and Jaime, they had denied Tyrion. He was a dwarf, half his \nbrother\u2019s height, struggling to keep pace on stunted legs. His head was too large for his \nbody, with a brute\u2019s squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow.

He told himself he was fortunate in that too.\nHis eyes stung. Jon rubbed at them savagely, cursing the smoke. He swallowed another \ngulp of wine and watched his direwolf devour the chicken.\nDogs moved between the tables, trailing after the serving girls. One of them, a black \nmongrel bitch with long yellow eyes, caught a scent of the chicken. She stopped and \nedged under the bench to get a share. Jon watched the confrontation. The bitch growled \nlow in her throat and moved closer. Ghost looked up, silent, and fixed the dog with those \nhot red eyes. The bitch snapped an angry challenge. She was three times the size of the \ndirewolf pup. Ghost did not move. He stood over his prize and opened his mouth, baring \nhis fangs. The bitch tensed, barked again, then thought better of this fight. She turned \nand slunk away, with one last defiant snap to save her pride.

Robb would someday inherit Winterfell, would command great armies as the \nWarden of the North. Bran and Rickon would be Robb\u2019s bannermen and rule holdfasts \nin his name. His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the heirs of other great houses and \ngo south as mistress of castles of their own. But what place could a bastard hope to earn?\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking, Jon. The Night\u2019s Watch is a sworn brotherhood. We \nhave no families. None of us will ever father sons. Our wife is duty. Our mistress is \nhonor.\u201d\n\u201cA bastard can have honor too,\u201d Jon said. \u201cI am ready to swear your oath.\u201d\n\u201cYou are a boy of fourteen,\u201d Benjen said. \u201cNot a man, not yet. Until you have known a \nwoman, you cannot understand what you would be giving up.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about that!\u201d Jon said hotly.\n\u201cYou might, if you knew what it meant,\u201d Benjen said. \u201cIf you knew what the oath would \ncost you, you might be less eager to pay the price, son.\u201d\nJon felt anger rise inside him. \u201cI\u2019m not your son!\u201d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2125, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "228c60bf-ae99-4a70-a99d-4bdea8b0fe60": {"__data__": {"id_": "228c60bf-ae99-4a70-a99d-4bdea8b0fe60", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4a838eac-6b20-46fc-bfaf-b9b5982618c8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "hash": "f874febfb19c1c3ddb8a488f53592c9c0af11df20b6c8feddc567db56df1aaa2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Benjen Stark stood up. \u201cMore\u2019s the pity.\u201d He put a hand on Jon\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCome back \nto me after you\u2019ve fathered a few bastards of your own, and we\u2019ll see how you feel.\u201d\nJon trembled. \u201cI will never father a bastard,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cNever!\u201d He spat it out \nlike venom.\nSuddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent, and they were all looking at him.

She \nseldom had to light a fire. The castle had been built over natural hot springs, and the \nscalding waters rushed through its walls and chambers like blood through a man\u2019s body, \ndriving the chill from the stone halls, filling the glass gardens with a moist warmth, \nkeeping the earth from freezing. Open pools smoked day and night in a dozen small \ncourtyards. That was a little thing, in summer; in winter, it was the difference between \nlife and death.\nCatelyn\u2019s bath was always hot and steaming, and her walls warm to the touch. The \nwarmth reminded her of Riverrun, of days in the sun with Lysa and Edmure, but Ned \ncould never abide the heat. The Starks were made for the cold, he would tell her, and she \nwould laugh and tell him in that case they had certainly built their castle in the wrong \nplace.\nSo when they had finished, Ned rolled off and climbed from her bed, as he had a \nthousand times before. He crossed the room, pulled back the heavy tapestries, and threw \nopen the high narrow windows one by one, letting the night air into the chamber.\nThe wind swirled around him as he stood facing the dark, naked and empty-handed. \nCatelyn pulled the furs to her chin and watched him. He looked somehow smaller and \nmore vulnerable, like the youth she had wed in the sept at Riverrun, fifteen long years \ngone. Her loins still ached from the urgency of his lovemaking. It was a good ache. She \ncould feel his seed within her. She prayed that it might quicken there. It had been three \nyears since Rickon. She was not too old. She could give him another son.\n\u201cI will refuse him,\u201d Ned said as he turned back to her. His eyes were haunted, his voice \nthick with doubt.\nCatelyn sat up in the bed. \u201cYou cannot. You must not.\u201d\n\u201cMy duties are here in the north. I have no wish to be Robert\u2019s Hand.\u201d\n\u201cHe will not understand that. He is a king now, and kings are not like other men.

When the wars were over at \nlast, and Catelyn rode to Winterfell, Jon and his wet nurse had already taken up \nresidence.\nThat cut deep. Ned would not speak of the mother, not so much as a word, but a castle \nhas no secrets, and Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of \nher husband\u2019s soldiers. They whispered of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, \ndeadliest of the seven knights of Aerys\u2019s Kingsguard, and of how their young lord had \nslain him in single combat. And they told how afterward Ned had carried Ser Arthur\u2019s \nsword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called Starfall on \nthe shores of the Summer Sea. The Lady Ashara Dayne, tall and fair, with haunting \nviolet eyes. It had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage, but finally, in bed one \nnight, Catelyn had asked her husband the truth of it, asked him to his face.\nThat was the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her. \u201cNever ask me \nabout Jon,\u201d he said, cold as ice. \u201cHe is my blood, and that is all you need to know. And \nnow I will learn where you heard that name, my lady.\u201d She had pledged to obey; she told \nhim; and from that day on, the whispering had stopped, and Ashara Dayne\u2019s name was \nnever heard in Winterfell again.\nWhoever Jon\u2019s mother had been, Ned must have loved her fiercely, for nothing Catelyn \nsaid would persuade him to send the boy away. It was the one thing she could never \nforgive him. She had come to love her husband with all her heart, but she had never \nfound it in her to love Jon. She might have overlooked a dozen bastards for Ned\u2019s sake, \nso long as they were out of sight. Jon was never out of sight, and as he grew, he looked \nmore like Ned than any of the trueborn sons she bore him. Somehow that made it worse. \n\u201cJon must go,\u201d she said now.\n\u201cHe and Robb are close,\u201d Ned said. \u201cI had hoped . . . \u201d\n\u201cHe cannot stay here,\u201d Catelyn said, cutting him off. \u201cHe is your son, not mine. I will not \nhave him.\u201d It was hard, she knew, but no less the truth. Ned would do the boy no \nkindness by leaving him here at Winterfell.\nThe look Ned gave her was anguished. \u201cYou know I cannot take him south. There will be \nno place for him at court. A boy with a bastard\u2019s name . . . you know what they will say of \nhim. He will be shunned.\u201d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2719, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d532dc3-5b91-45c5-96eb-6270bf963bc2": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d532dc3-5b91-45c5-96eb-6270bf963bc2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "01425bea-c21b-4fef-8ba6-e7fc8d4d0b9e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "hash": "f5e001cacb854dfbeed99d5cb68607ea17e40cb976fd0d5d806104bbd8a1a06f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Catelyn armored her heart against the mute appeal in her husband\u2019s eyes. \u201cThey say \nyour friend Robert has fathered a dozen bastards himself.\u201d\n\u201cAnd none of them has ever been seen at court!\u201d Ned blazed. \u201cThe Lannister woman has \nseen to that.

Let Ned work it out in his own mind; her voice would not be \nwelcome now. Yet gladly would she have kissed the maester just then. His was the \nperfect solution. Benjen Stark was a Sworn Brother. Jon would be a son to him, the child \nhe would never have. And in time the boy would take the oath as well. He would father \nno sons who might someday contest with Catelyn\u2019s own grandchildren for Winterfell.\nMaester Luwin said, \u201cThere is great honor in service on the Wall, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cAnd even a bastard may rise high in the Night\u2019s Watch,\u201d Ned reflected.

It hurt that the one thing Arya \ncould do better than her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household. \nSansa had never had much of a head for figures. If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped \nfor his sake that he had a good steward.\nNymeria was waiting for her in the guardroom at the base of the stairs. She bounded to \nher feet as soon as she caught sight of Arya. Arya grinned. The wolf pup loved her, even \nif no one else did. They went everywhere together, and Nymeria slept in her room, at the \nfoot of her bed. If Mother had not forbidden it, Arya would gladly have taken the wolf \nwith her to needlework. Let Septa Mordane complain about her stitches then.\nNymeria nipped eagerly at her hand as Arya untied her. She had yellow eyes. When they \ncaught the sunlight, they gleamed like two golden coins. Arya had named her after the \nwarrior queen of the Rhoyne, who had led her people across the narrow sea. That had \nbeen a great scandal too. Sansa, of course, had named her pup \u201cLady.\u201d Arya made a face \nand hugged the wolfling tight.

The White Bull, \nGerold Hightower. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Barristan the Bold.\nTwo of the Kingsguard had come north with King Robert.

Father had promised that they would meet Ser Barristan when they reached \nKing\u2019s Landing, and Bran had been marking the days on his wall, eager to depart, to see \na world he had only dreamed of and begin a life he could scarcely imagine.\nYet now that the last day was at hand, suddenly Bran felt lost. Winterfell had been the \nonly home he had ever known. His father had told him that he ought to say his farewells \ntoday, and he had tried. After the hunt had ridden out, he wandered through the castle \nwith his wolf at his side, intending to visit the ones who would be left behind, Old Nan \nand Gage the cook, Mikken in his smithy, Hodor the stableboy who smiled so much and \ntook care of his pony and never said anything but \u201cHodor,\u201d the man in the glass gardens \nwho gave him a blackberry when he came to visit . . . \nBut it was no good. He had gone to the stable first, and seen his pony there in its stall, \nexcept it wasn\u2019t his pony anymore, he was getting a real horse and leaving the pony \nbehind, and all of a sudden Bran just wanted to sit down and cry. He turned and ran off \nbefore Hodor and the other stableboys could see the tears in his eyes. That was the end \nof his farewells. Instead Bran spent the morning alone in the godswood, trying to teach \nhis wolf to fetch a stick, and failing. The wolfling was smarter than any of the hounds in \nhis father\u2019s kennel and Bran would have sworn he understood every word that was said \nto him, but he showed very little interest in chasing sticks.\nHe was still trying to decide on a name. Robb was calling his Grey Wind, because he ran \nso fast. Sansa had named hers Lady, and Arya named hers after some old witch queen in \nthe songs, and little Rickon called his Shaggydog, which Bran thought was a pretty \nstupid name for a direwolf. Jon\u2019s wolf, the white one, was Ghost. Bran wished he had \nthought of that first, even though his wolf wasn\u2019t white. He had tried a hundred names \nin the last fortnight, but none of them sounded right.\nFinally he got tired of the stick game and decided to go climbing. He hadn\u2019t been up to \nthe broken tower for weeks with everything that had happened, and this might be his \nlast chance.\nHe raced across the godswood, taking the long way around to avoid the pool where the \nheart tree grew. The heart tree had always frightened him; trees ought not have eyes, \nBran thought, or leaves that looked like hands. His wolf came sprinting at his heels. \u201cYou \nstay here,\u201d he told him at the base of the sentinel tree near the armory wall. \u201cLie down. \nThat\u2019s right. Now stay\u2014\u201d\nThe wolf did as he was told. Bran scratched him behind the ears, then turned away, \njumped, grabbed a low branch, and pulled himself up.

His wolf fell silent, staring up at him through slitted yellow \neyes. A strange chill went through him. He began to climb again.

You\u2019re worse than Mother.\u201d The howling \nchased him all the way up the tree, until finally he jumped off onto the armory roof and \nout of sight.\nThe rooftops of Winterfell were Bran\u2019s second home. His mother often said that Bran \ncould climb before he could walk. Bran could not remember when he first learned to \nwalk, but he could not remember when he started to climb either, so he supposed it must \nbe true.\nTo a boy, Winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and \ntunnels spreading out in all directions. In the older parts of the castle, the halls slanted \nup and down so that you couldn\u2019t even be sure what floor you were on. The place had \ngrown over the centuries like some monstrous stone tree, Maester Luwin told him once, \nand its branches were gnarled and thick and twisted, its roots sunk deep into the earth.\nWhen he got out from under it and scrambled up near the sky, Bran could see all of \nWinterfell in a glance. He liked the way it looked, spread out beneath him, only birds \nwheeling over his head while all the life of the castle went on below. Bran could perch for \nhours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the First Keep, \nwatching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the cooks tending their \nvegetables in the glass garden, restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels, the \nsilence of the godswood, the girls gossiping beside the washing well. It made him feel \nlike he was lord of the castle, in a way even Robb would never know.\nIt taught him Winterfell\u2019s secrets too. The builders had not even leveled the earth; there \nwere hills and valleys behind the walls of Winterfell. There was a covered bridge that \nwent from the fourth floor of the bell tower across to the second floor of the rookery. \nBran knew about that. And he knew you could get inside the inner wall by the south gate, \nclimb three floors and run all the way around Winterfell through a narrow tunnel in the \nstone, and then come out on ground level at the north gate, with a hundred feet of wall \nlooming over you. Even Maester Luwin didn\u2019t know that, Bran was convinced.\nHis mother was terrified that one day Bran would slip off a wall and kill himself. He told \nher that he wouldn\u2019t, but she never believed him. Once she made him promise that he \nwould stay on the ground. He had managed to keep that promise for almost a fortnight, \nmiserable every day, until one night he had gone out the window of his bedroom when \nhis brothers were fast asleep.\nHe confessed his crime the next day in a fit of guilt.

So be it. If you must climb, then \nclimb, but try not to let your mother see you.\u201d\nBran did his best, although he did not think he ever really fooled her. Since his father \nwould not forbid it, she turned to others. Old Nan told him a story about a bad little boy \nwho climbed too high and was struck down by lightning, and how afterward the crows \ncame to peck out his eyes. Bran was not impressed. There were crows\u2019 nests atop the \nbroken tower, where no one ever went but him, and sometimes he filled his pockets with \ncorn before he climbed up there and the crows ate it right out of his hand. None of them \nhad ever shown the slightest bit of interest in pecking out his eyes.\nLater, Maester Luwin built a little pottery boy and dressed him in Bran\u2019s clothes and \nflung him off the wall into the yard below, to demonstrate what would happen to Bran if \nhe fell. That had been fun, but afterward Bran just looked at the maester and said, \u201cI\u2019m \nnot made of clay.

It was like playing a game with his \nbrothers, except that Bran always won. None of the guards could climb half so well as \nBran, not even Jory. Most of the time they never saw him anyway. People never looked \nup. That was another thing he liked about climbing; it was almost like being invisible.\nHe liked how it felt too, pulling himself up a wall stone by stone, fingers and toes digging \nhard into the small crevices between. He always took off his boots and went barefoot \nwhen he climbed; it made him feel as if he had four hands instead of two. He liked the \ndeep, sweet ache it left in the muscles afterward. He liked the way the air tasted way up \nhigh, sweet and cold as a winter peach. He liked the birds: the crows in the broken \ntower, the tiny little sparrows that nested in cracks between the stones, the ancient owl \nthat slept in the dusty loft above the old armory. Bran knew them all.\nMost of all, he liked going places that no one else could go, and seeing the grey sprawl of \nWinterfell in a way that no one else ever saw it. It made the whole castle Bran\u2019s secret \nplace.\nHis favorite haunt was the broken tower. Once it had been a watchtower, the tallest in \nWinterfell.

You could climb straight up the side of the tower itself, \nbut the stones were loose, the mortar that held them together long gone to ash, and Bran \nnever liked to put his full weight on them.\nThe best way was to start from the godswood, shinny up the tall sentinel, and cross over \nthe armory and the guards hall, leaping roof to roof, barefoot so the guards wouldn\u2019t \nhear you overhead. That brought you up to the blind side of the First Keep, the oldest \npart of the castle, a squat round fortress that was taller than it looked. Only rats and \nspiders lived there now but the old stones still made for good climbing. You could go \nstraight up to where the gargoyles leaned out blindly over empty space, and swing from \ngargoyle to gargoyle, hand over hand, around to the north side. From there, if you really \nstretched, you could reach out and pull yourself over to the broken tower where it leaned \nclose.

The sound hung over \nthe castle like a flag of mourning.\nTyrion Lannister looked up from his books and shivered, though the library was snug \nand warm. Something about the howling of a wolf took a man right out of his here and \nnow and left him in a dark forest of the mind, running naked before the pack.\nWhen the direwolf howled again, Tyrion shut the heavy leatherbound cover on the book \nhe was reading, a hundred-year-old discourse on the changing of the seasons by a long-\ndead maester. He covered a yawn with the back of his hand. His reading lamp was \nflickering, its oil all but gone, as dawn light leaked through the high windows. He had \nbeen at it all night, but that was nothing new. Tyrion Lannister was not much a one for \nsleeping.\nHis legs were stiff and sore as he eased down off the bench. He massaged some life back \ninto them and limped heavily to the table where the septon was snoring softly, his head \npillowed on an open book in front of him. Tyrion glanced at the title. A life of the Grand \nMaester Aethelmure, no wonder. \u201cChayle,\u201d he said softly. The young man jerked up, \nblinking, confused, the crystal of his order swinging wildly on its silver chain. \u201cI\u2019m off to \nbreak my fast. See that you return the books to the shelves. Be gentle with the Valyrian \nscrolls, the parchment is very dry. Ayrmidon\u2019s Engines of War is quite rare, and yours is \nthe only complete copy I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Chayle gaped at him, still half-asleep. Patiently, \nTyrion repeated his instructions, then clapped the septon on the shoulder and left him to \nhis tasks.\nOutside, Tyrion swallowed a lungful of the cold morning air and began his laborious \ndescent of the steep stone steps that corkscrewed around the exterior of the library \ntower. It was slow going; the steps were cut high and narrow, while his legs were short \nand twisted. The rising sun had not yet cleared the walls of Winterfell, but the men were \nalready hard at it in the yard below. Sandor Clegane\u2019s rasping voice drifted up to him. \n\u201cThe boy is a long time dying. I wish he would be quicker about it.\u201d\nTyrion glanced down and saw the Hound standing with young Joffrey as squires \nswarmed around them. \u201cAt least he dies quietly,\u201d the prince replied. \u201cIt\u2019s the wolf that \nmakes the noise.

A mighty earthen ramp had been raised amid the grass palaces, \nand there Dany was seated beside Khal Drogo, above the seething sea of Dothraki. She \nhad never seen so many people in one place, nor people so strange and frightening. The \nhorselords might put on rich fabrics and sweet perfumes when they visited the Free \nCities, but out under the open sky they kept the old ways. Men and women alike wore \npainted leather vests over bare chests and horsehair leggings cinched by bronze \nmedallion belts, and the warriors greased their long braids with fat from the rendering \npits. They gorged themselves on horseflesh roasted with honey and peppers, drank \nthemselves blind on fermented mare\u2019s milk and Illyrio\u2019s fine wines, and spat jests at \neach other across the fires, their voices harsh and alien in Dany\u2019s ears.\nViserys was seated just below her, splendid in a new black wool tunic with a scarlet", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2693, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b5f14fd-65ae-4b01-a1c5-91bf74fc9b87": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b5f14fd-65ae-4b01-a1c5-91bf74fc9b87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6540bef9-eb14-4573-ad9a-5a81724cb367", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "hash": "bd62a2dc351f7fe7ad4f72c12a49fbd4dcacf700e9336863ee5a20f8bb9fff1f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "dragon on the chest.

He did not like sitting beneath her, and he fumed when the slaves \noffered each dish first to the khal and his bride, and served him from the portions they \nrefused. He could do nothing but nurse his resentment, so nurse it he did, his mood \ngrowing blacker by the hour at each insult to his person.\nDany had never felt so alone as she did seated in the midst of that vast horde. Her \nbrother had told her to smile, and so she smiled until her face ached and the tears came \nunbidden to her eyes. She did her best to hide them, knowing how angry Viserys would \nbe if he saw her crying, terrified of how Khal Drogo might react. Food was brought to \nher, steaming joints of meat and thick black sausages and Dothraki blood pies, and later \nfruits and sweetgrass stews and delicate pastries from the kitchens of Pentos, but she \nwaved it all away. Her stomach was a roil, and she knew she could keep none of it down.\nThere was no one to talk to. Khal Drogo shouted commands and jests down to his \nbloodriders, and laughed at their replies, but he scarcely glanced at Dany beside him. \nThey had no common language. Dothraki was incomprehensible to her, and the khal \nknew only a few words of the bastard Valyrian of the Free Cities, and none at all of the \nCommon Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms. She would even have welcomed the \nconversation of Illyrio and her brother, but they were too far below to hear her.\nSo she sat in her wedding silks, nursing a cup of honeyed wine, afraid to eat, talking \nsilently to herself. I am blood of the dragon, she told herself. I am Daenerys Stormborn, \nPrincess of Dragonstone, of the blood and seed of Aegon the Conqueror.\nThe sun was only a quarter of the way up the sky when she saw her first man die. Drums \nwere beating as some of the women danced for the khal. Drogo watched without \nexpression, but his eyes followed their movements, and from time to time he would toss \ndown a bronze medallion for the women to fight over.\nThe warriors were watching too. One of them finally stepped into the circle, grabbed a \ndancer by the arm, pushed her down to the ground, and mounted her right there, as a \nstallion mounts a mare. Illyrio had told her that might happen. \u201cThe Dothraki mate like \nthe animals in their herds. There is no privacy in a khalasar, and they do not understand \nsin or shame as we do.\u201d\nDany looked away from the coupling, frightened when she realized what was happening, \nbut a second warrior stepped forward, and a third, and soon there was no way to avert \nher eyes. Then two men seized the same woman. She heard a shout, saw a shove, and in \nthe blink of an eye the arakhs were out, long razor-sharp blades, half sword and half \nscythe.

Her wedding must have been \nespecially blessed; before the day was over, a dozen men had died.\nAs the hours passed, the terror grew in Dany, until it was all she could do not to scream. \nShe was afraid of the Dothraki, whose ways seemed alien and monstrous, as if they were \nbeasts in human skins and not true men at all. She was afraid of her brother, of what he \nmight do if she failed him.

The surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales, and as \nshe turned the egg between her fingers, they shimmered like polished metal in the light \nof the setting sun. One egg was a deep green, with burnished bronze flecks that came \nand went depending on how Dany turned it. Another was pale cream streaked with gold. \nThe last was black, as black as a midnight sea, yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls. \n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d she asked, her voice hushed and full of wonder.\n\u201cDragon\u2019s eggs, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai,\u201d said Magister Illyrio. \u201cThe eons \nhave turned them to stone, yet still they burn bright with beauty.\u201d\n\u201cI shall treasure them always.\u201d Dany had heard tales of such eggs, but she had never \nseen one, nor thought to see one. It was a truly magnificent gift, though she knew that \nIllyrio could afford to be lavish. He had collected a fortune in horses and slaves for his \npart in selling her to Khal Drogo.\nThe khal\u2019s bloodriders offered her the traditional three weapons, and splendid weapons \nthey were.

The king jerked the \nreins hard, quieting the animal, and pointed an angry finger at Ned. \u201cI will kill every \nTargaryen I can get my hands on, until they are as dead as their dragons, and then I will \npiss on their graves.\u201d\nNed knew better than to defy him when the wrath was on him. If the years had not \nquenched Robert\u2019s thirst for revenge, no words of his would help. \u201cYou can\u2019t get your \nhands on this one, can you?\u201d he said quietly.\nThe king\u2019s mouth twisted in a bitter grimace. \u201cNo, gods be cursed. Some pox-ridden \nPentoshi cheesemonger had her brother and her walled up on his estate with pointy-\nhatted eunuchs all around them, and now he\u2019s handed them over to the Dothraki. I \nshould have had them both killed years ago, when it was easy to get at them, but Jon was \nas bad as you. More fool I, I listened to him.\u201d\n\u201cJon Arryn was a wise man and a good Hand.\u201d\nRobert snorted. The anger was leaving him as suddenly as it had come. \u201cThis Khal Drogo \nis said to have a hundred thousand men in his horde. What would Jon say to that?\u201d\n\u201cHe would say that even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, so long as they \nremain on the other side of the narrow sea,\u201d Ned replied calmly. \u201cThe barbarians have \nno ships.

There \nthe banners and the wagons and the columns of knights and freeriders turned south, \ntaking the tumult with them, while Tyrion turned north with Benjen Stark and his \nnephew.\nIt had grown colder after that, and far more quiet.\nWest of the road were flint hills, grey and rugged, with tall watchtowers on their stony \nsummits. To the east the land was lower, the ground flattening to a rolling plain that \nstretched away as far as the eye could see. Stone bridges spanned swift, narrow rivers, \nwhile small farms spread in rings around holdfasts walled in wood and stone. The road \nwas well trafficked, and at night for their comfort there were rude inns to be found.\nThree days ride from Winterfell, however, the farmland gave way to dense wood, and the \nkingsroad grew lonely. The flint hills rose higher and wilder with each passing mile, until \nby the fifth day they had turned into mountains, cold blue-grey giants with jagged \npromontories and snow on their shoulders.

He had \nbrought his warmest clothing with him when they rode out of Winterfell, and soon \ndiscovered that it was nowhere near warm enough. It was cold up here, and growing \ncolder. The nights were well below freezing now, and when the wind blew it was like a \nknife cutting right through his warmest woolens. By now Stark was no doubt regretting \nhis chivalrous impulse. Perhaps he had learned a lesson. The Lannisters never declined, \ngraciously or otherwise. The Lannisters took what was offered.\nFarms and holdfasts grew scarcer and smaller as they pressed northward, ever deeper \ninto the darkness of the wolfswood, until finally there were no more roofs to shelter \nunder, and they were thrown back on their own resources.\nTyrion was never much use in making a camp or breaking one.

A grotesquely ancient oak provided shelter \nfrom the biting wind. Tyrion curled up in his fur with his back against the trunk, took a \nsip of the wine, and began to read about the properties of dragonbone. Dragonbone is \nblack because of its high iron content, the book told him. It is strong as steel, yet lighter \nand far more flexible, and of course utterly impervious to fire. Dragonbone bows are \ngreatly prized by the Dothraki, and small wonder. An archer so armed can outrange \nany wooden bow.\nTyrion had a morbid fascination with dragons.

King Robert \nhad replaced them with banners and tapestries, but Tyrion had persisted until he found \nthe skulls in the dank cellar where they had been stored.\nHe had expected to find them impressive, perhaps even frightening.

Dense thickets of half-\ndrowned trees pressed close around them, branches dripping with curtains of pale \nfungus.

She would have \nliked a sister like that.\nSansa could never understand how two sisters, born only two years apart, could be so \ndifferent.

Perhaps the grumkins had stolen her \nreal sister. But Mother had only laughed and said no, Arya was her daughter and Sansa\u2019s \ntrueborn sister, blood of their blood. Sansa could not think why Mother would want to \nlie about it, so she supposed it had to be true.\nAs she neared the center of camp, her distress was quickly forgotten.

The air was warm and heavy with the scent of \nflowers, and the woods here had a gentle beauty that Sansa had never seen in the north. \nPrince Joffrey\u2019s mount was a blood bay courser, swift as the wind, and he rode it with \nreckless abandon, so fast that Sansa was hard-pressed to keep up on her mare.

The girl, a \nscrawny thing in soiled leathers, was dodging and managing to get her stick in the way of \nmost of the boy\u2019s blows, but not all. When she tried to lunge at him, he caught her stick \nwith his own, swept it aside, and slid his wood down hard on her fingers. She cried out \nand lost her weapon.\nPrince Joffrey laughed.

The \nStorm Dancer was his fourth ship, and his fastest, a two-masted galley of sixty oars.\nShe had certainly been the fastest of the ships available in White Harbor when Catelyn \nand Ser Rodrik Cassel had arrived after their headlong gallop downriver. The Tyroshi \nwere notorious for their avarice, and Ser Rodrik had argued for hiring a fishing sloop out \nof the Three Sisters, but Catelyn had insisted on the galley. It was good that she had. The \nwinds had been against them much of the voyage, and without the galley\u2019s oars they\u2019d \nstill be beating their way past the Fingers, instead of skimming toward King\u2019s Landing \nand journey\u2019s end.\nSo close, she thought. Beneath the linen bandages, her fingers still throbbed where the \ndagger had bitten. The pain was her scourge, Catelyn felt, lest she forget. She could not \nbend the last two fingers on her left hand, and the others would never again be \ndexterous. Yet that was a small enough price to pay for Bran\u2019s life.\nSer Rodrik chose that moment to appear on deck. \u201cMy good friend,\u201d said Moreo through \nhis forked green beard.

Then Aegon the Conqueror had sailed from \nDragonstone. It was here that his army had put ashore, and there on the highest hill that \nhe built his first crude redoubt of wood and earth.\nNow the city covered the shore as far as Catelyn could see; manses and arbors and \ngranaries, brick storehouses and timbered inns and merchant\u2019s stalls, taverns and \ngraveyards and brothels, all piled one on another. She could hear the clamor of the fish \nmarket even at this distance. Between the buildings were broad roads lined with trees, \nwandering crookback streets, and alleys so narrow that two men could not walk abreast. \nVisenya\u2019s hill was crowned by the Great Sept of Baelor with its seven crystal towers. \nAcross the city on the hill of Rhaenys stood the blackened walls of the Dragonpit, its \nhuge dome collapsing into ruin, its bronze doors closed now for a century. The Street of \nthe Sisters ran between them, straight as an arrow. The city walls rose in the distance, \nhigh and strong.\nA hundred quays lined the waterfront, and the harbor was crowded with ships. \nDeepwater fishing boats and river runners came and went, ferrymen poled back and \nforth across the Blackwater Rush, trading galleys unloaded goods from Braavos and \nPentos and Lys.

Jon knocked his sword from his fingers with a slash to his wrist that \nbrought a cry of pain.\n\u201cEnough!\u201d Ser Alliser Thorne had a voice with an edge like Valyrian steel.\nGrenn cradled his hand. \u201cThe bastard broke my wrist.\u201d\n\u201cThe bastard hamstrung you, opened your empty skull, and cut off your hand.

It\u2019s fortunate for you that the Watch needs stableboys \nas well as rangers.\u201d Ser Alliser gestured at Jeren and Toad. \u201cGet the Aurochs on his feet, \nhe has funeral arrangements to make.\u201d\nJon took off his helm as the other boys were pulling Grenn to his feet. The frosty \nmorning air felt good on his face. He leaned on his sword, drew a deep breath, and \nallowed himself a moment to savor the victory.\n\u201cThat is a longsword, not an old man\u2019s cane,\u201d Ser Alliser said sharply. \u201cAre your legs \nhurting, Lord Snow?\u201d\nJon hated that name, a mockery that Ser Alliser had hung on him the first day he came \nto practice. The boys had picked it up, and now he heard it everywhere. He slid the \nlongsword back into its scabbard. \u201cNo,\u201d he replied.\nThorne strode toward him, crisp black leathers whispering faintly as he moved.

The chill was always with him here. In a few years he would \nforget what it felt like to be warm.\nThe weariness came on him suddenly, as he donned the roughspun blacks that were \ntheir everyday wear. He sat on a bench, his fingers fumbling with the fastenings on his \ncloak. So cold, he thought, remembering the warm halls of Winterfell, where the hot \nwaters ran through the walls like blood through a man\u2019s body. There was scant warmth \nto be found in Castle Black; the walls were cold here, and the people colder.\nNo one had told him the Night\u2019s Watch would be like this; no one except Tyrion \nLannister.

The Night\u2019s Watch has become an army of \nsullen boys and tired old men. Apart from the men at my table tonight, I have perhaps \ntwenty who can read, and even fewer who can think, or plan, or lead. Once the Watch \nspent its summers building, and each Lord Commander raised the Wall higher than he \nfound it. Now it is all we can do to stay alive.\u201d\nHe was in deadly earnest, Tyrion realized.

He set off across the yard for his own chambers in the King\u2019s Tower, \nwalking as briskly as his legs could manage. Patches of snow crunched beneath his feet \nas his boots broke the night\u2019s crust, and his breath steamed before him like a banner.

Tyrion stopped for a moment to look up at it. His legs ached of cold and \nhaste.\nSuddenly a strange madness took hold of him, a yearning to look once more off the end \nof the world. It would be his last chance, he thought; tomorrow he would ride south, and \nhe could not imagine why he would ever want to return to this frozen desolation. The \nKing\u2019s Tower was before him, with its promise of warmth and a soft bed, yet Tyrion \nfound himself walking past it, toward the vast pale palisade of the Wall.\nA wooden stair ascended the south face, anchored on huge rough-hewn beams sunk \ndeep into the ice and frozen in place. Back and forth it switched, clawing its way upward \nas crooked as a bolt of lightning. The black brothers assured him that it was much \nstronger than it looked, but Tyrion\u2019s legs were cramping too badly for him to even \ncontemplate the ascent. He went instead to the iron cage beside the well, clambered \ninside, and yanked hard on the bell rope, three quick pulls.\nHe had to wait what seemed an eternity, standing there inside the bars with the Wall to \nhis back. Long enough for Tyrion to begin to wonder why he was doing this. He had just \nabout decided to forget his sudden whim and go to bed when the cage gave a jerk and \nbegan to ascend.\nHe moved upward slowly, by fits and starts at first, then more smoothly.

Morrec had a fire burning in \nhis room, he noted with approval, but the Lord Commander\u2019s tower was dark. The Old \nBear had more sense than he did, it seemed.\nThen he was above the towers, still inching his way upward. Castle Black lay below him, \netched in moonlight. You could see how stark and empty it was from up here; \nwindowless keeps, crumbling walls, courtyards choked with broken stone. Farther off, he \ncould see the lights of Mole\u2019s Town, the little village half a league south along the \nkingsroad, and here and there the bright glitter of moonlight on water where icy streams \ndescended from the mountain heights to cut across the plains. The rest of the world was \na bleak emptiness of windswept hills and rocky fields spotted with snow.\nFinally a thick voice behind him said, \u201cSeven hells, it\u2019s the dwarf,\u201d and the cage jerked to \na sudden stop and hung there, swinging slowly back and forth, the ropes creaking.\n\u201cBring him in, damn it.\u201d There was a grunt and a loud groaning of wood as the cage slid \nsideways and then the Wall was beneath him. Tyrion waited until the swinging had \nstopped before he pushed open the cage door and hopped down onto the ice. A heavy \nfigure in black was leaning on the winch, while a second held the cage with a gloved \nhand. Their faces were muffled in woolen scarves so only their eyes showed, and they \nwere plump with layers of wool and leather, black on black. \u201cAnd what will you be \nwanting, this time of night?\u201d the one by the winch asked.\n\u201cA last look.\u201d\nThe men exchanged sour glances. \u201cLook all you want,\u201d the other one said. \u201cJust have a \ncare you don\u2019t fall off, little man.

And \nthen he was alone.\nIt was bitingly cold up here, and the wind pulled at his clothes like an insistent lover. The \ntop of the Wall was wider than the kingsroad often was, so Tyrion had no fear of falling, \nalthough the footing was slicker than he would have liked.

Tyrion had heard that elsewhere along the \nWall, between the three fortresses, the wildwood had come creeping back over the \ndecades, that there were places where grey-green sentinels and pale white weirwoods \nhad taken root in the shadow of the Wall itself, but Castle Black had a prodigious \nappetite for firewood, and here the forest was still kept at bay by the axes of the black \nbrothers.\nIt was never far, though. From up here Tyrion could see it, the dark trees looming \nbeyond the stretch of open ground, like a second wall built parallel to the first, a wall of \nnight. Few axes had ever swung in that black wood, where even the moonlight could not \npenetrate the ancient tangle of root and thorn and grasping limb. Out there the trees \ngrew huge, and the rangers said they seemed to brood and knew not men. It was small \nwonder the Night\u2019s Watch named it the haunted forest.\nAs he stood there and looked at all that darkness with no fires burning anywhere, with \nthe wind blowing and the cold like a spear in his guts, Tyrion Lannister felt as though he \ncould almost believe the talk of the Others, the enemy in the night.

She wanted Jon to muss up her hair and call her \u201clittle sister\u201d and finish her \nsentences with her. But all of them were gone.

Dany had \nno place in these parts of his life. She was left to sup alone, or with Ser Jorah and her \nbrother, and afterward to cry herself to sleep. Yet every night, some time before the \ndawn, Drogo would come to her tent and wake her in the dark, to ride her as relentlessly \nas he rode his stallion. He always took her from behind, Dothraki fashion, for which \nDany was grateful; that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet her face, \nand she could use her pillow to muffle her cries of pain. When he was done, he would \nclose his eyes and begin to snore softly and Dany would lie beside him, her body bruised \nand sore, hurting too much for sleep.\nDay followed day, and night followed night, until Dany knew she could not endure a \nmoment longer. She would kill herself rather than go on, she decided one night . . . \nYet when she slept that night, she dreamt the dragon dream again. Viserys was not in it \nthis time.

The Dothraki were a hard and unsentimental people, and it was not their custom to \nname their animals, so Dany thought of her only as the silver. She had never loved \nanything so much.\nAs the riding became less an ordeal, Dany began to notice the beauties of the land \naround her. She rode at the head of the khalasar with Drogo and his bloodriders, so she \ncame to each country fresh and unspoiled. Behind them the great horde might tear the \nearth and muddy the rivers and send up clouds of choking dust, but the fields ahead of \nthem were always green and verdant.\nThey crossed the rolling hills of Norvos, past terraced farms and small villages where the \ntownsfolk watched anxiously from atop white stucco walls. They forded three wide \nplacid rivers and a fourth that was swift and narrow and treacherous, camped beside a \nhigh blue waterfall, skirted the tumbled ruins of a vast dead city where ghosts were said \nto moan among blackened marble columns. They raced down Valyrian roads a thousand \nyears old and straight as a Dothraki arrow. For half a moon, they rode through the \nForest of Qohor, where the leaves made a golden canopy high above them, and the \ntrunks of the trees were as wide as city gates.

She began to \nfind pleasure even in her nights, and if she still cried out when Drogo took her, it was not \nalways in pain.\nAt the bottom of the ridge, the grasses rose around her, tall and supple. Dany slowed to a \ntrot and rode out onto the plain, losing herself in the green, blessedly alone. In the \nkhalasar she was never alone. Khal Drogo came to her only after the sun went down, but \nher handmaids fed her and bathed her and slept by the door of her tent, Drogo\u2019s \nbloodriders and the men of her khas were never far, and her brother was an unwelcome \nshadow, day and night.

The air was rich with the scents of earth and grass, mixed \nwith the smell of horseflesh and Dany\u2019s sweat and the oil in her hair. Dothraki smells. \nThey seemed to belong here. Dany breathed it all in, laughing. She had a sudden urge to \nfeel the ground beneath her, to curl her toes in that thick black soil. Swinging down from \nher saddle, she let the silver graze while she pulled off her high boots.\nViserys came upon her as sudden as a summer storm, his horse rearing beneath him as \nhe reined up too hard. \u201cYou dare!\u201d he screamed at her. \u201cYou give commands to me? To \nme?\u201d He vaulted off the horse, stumbling as he landed. His face was flushed as he \nstruggled back to his feet. He grabbed her, shook her. \u201cHave you forgotten who you are? \nLook at you. Look at you!\u201d\nDany did not need to look. She was barefoot, with oiled hair, wearing Dothraki riding \nleathers and a painted vest given her as a bride gift. She looked as though she belonged \nhere.

The gargoyles watched him ascend. Their eyes glowed red \nas hot coals in a brazier. Perhaps once they had been lions, but now they were twisted \nand grotesque.

It was enough to weary even a strong man, and the Lord Jon was not young. \nSmall wonder if he seemed melancholy and tired. Or so I thought at the time. Yet now I \nam less certain.\u201d He gave a ponderous shake of his head.\n\u201cWhat can you tell me of his final illness?\u201d\nThe Grand Maester spread his hands in a gesture of helpless sorrow. \u201cHe came to me \none day asking after a certain book, as hale and healthy as ever, though it did seem to me \nthat something was troubling him deeply. The next morning he was twisted over in pain, \ntoo sick to rise from bed. Maester Colemon thought it was a chill on the stomach. The \nweather had been hot, and the Hand often iced his wine, which can upset the digestion. \nWhen Lord Jon continued to weaken, I went to him myself, but the gods did not grant \nme the power to save him.\u201d\n\u201cI have heard that you sent Maester Colemon away.\u201d\nThe Grand Maester\u2019s nod was as slow and deliberate as a glacier. \u201cI did, and I fear the \nLady Lysa will never forgive me that. Maybe I was wrong, but at the time I thought it \nbest. Maester Colemon is like a son to me, and I yield to none in my esteem for his \nabilities, but he is young, and the young ofttimes do not comprehend the frailty of an \nolder body. He was purging Lord Arryn with wasting potions and pepper juice, and I \nfeared he might kill him.\u201d\n\u201cDid Lord Arryn say anything to you during his final hours?\u201d\nPycelle wrinkled his brow. \u201cIn the last stage of his fever, the Hand called out the name \nRobert several times, but whether he was asking for his son or for the king I could not \nsay. Lady Lysa would not permit the boy to enter the sickroom, for fear that he too might \nbe taken ill. The king did come, and he sat beside the bed for hours, talking and joking of \ntimes long past in hopes of raising Lord Jon\u2019s spirits.

The fur collar of his embroidered surcoat was lost beneath his chins. Pale eyes \nmoved nervously in a great round moon of a face, and plump sweaty fingers wiped \nthemselves on the velvet of his doublet. \u201cThey  . . . they told me I was to come here \nfor . . . for training,\u201d he said to no one in particular.\n\u201cA lordling,\u201d Pyp observed to Jon. \u201cSouthron, most like near Highgarden.\u201d Pyp had \ntraveled the Seven Kingdoms with a mummers\u2019 troupe, and bragged that he could tell \nwhat you were and where you\u2019d been born just from the sound of your voice.\nA striding huntsman had been worked in scarlet thread upon the breast of the fat boy\u2019s \nfur-trimmed surcoat.

As none of it was \nblack, however, Ser Alliser insisted that he reequip himself from the armory. That took \nhalf the morning. His girth required Donal Noye to take apart a mail hauberk and refit it \nwith leather panels at the sides. To get a helm over his head the armorer had to detach \nthe visor. His leathers bound so tightly around his legs and under his arms that he could \nscarcely move.

Pyp backed him, as he\u2019d known he \nwould, but when Halder spoke up, it was a pleasant surprise. Grenn was anxious at the \nfirst, but Jon knew the words to move him. One by one the rest fell in line. Jon \npersuaded some, cajoled some, shamed the others, made threats where threats were \nrequired.

When \nSer Alliser matched them against him, they would stand their ground and swat aside his \nslow, clumsy strokes. If the master-at-arms screamed for an attack, they would dance in \nand tap Sam lightly on breastplate or helm or leg.

A few nights \nlater, at Jon\u2019s urging, he joined them for the evening meal, taking a place on the bench \nbeside Halder.

Robb and Bran \nand Rickon were his father\u2019s sons, and he loved them still, yet Jon knew that he had \nnever truly been one of them. Catelyn Stark had seen to that.

Pycelle had spoken truly; it made for ponderous \nreading. Yet Jon Arryn had asked for it, and Ned felt certain he had reasons. There was \nsomething here, some truth buried in these brittle yellow pages, if only he could see it. \nBut what? The tome was over a century old. Scarcely a man now alive had yet been born \nwhen Malleon had compiled his dusty lists of weddings, births, and deaths.\nHe opened to the section on House Lannister once more, and turned the pages slowly, \nhoping against hope that something would leap out at him. The Lannisters were an old \nfamily, tracing their descent back to Lann the Clever, a trickster from the Age of Heroes \nwho was no doubt as legendary as Bran the Builder, though far more beloved of singers \nand taletellers. In the songs, Lann was the fellow who winkled the Casterlys out of \nCasterly Rock with no weapon but his wits, and stole gold from the sun to brighten his \ncurly hair. Ned wished he were here now, to winkle the truth out of this damnable book.\nA sharp rap on the door heralded Jory Cassel. Ned closed Malleon\u2019s tome and bid him \nenter. \u201cI\u2019ve promised the City Watch twenty of my guard until the tourney is done,\u201d he \ntold him. \u201cI rely on you to make the choice.

Fast friends, they were.\u201d Jory snorted. \u201cThe Hand \nalways gave the lads a copper on their name days, he says. Had a way with horses. Never \nrode his mounts too hard, and brought them carrots and apples, so they were always \npleased to see him.\u201d\n\u201cCarrots and apples,\u201d Ned repeated. It sounded as if this boy would be even less use than \nthe others. And he was the last of the four Littlefinger had turned up. Jory had spoken to \neach of them in turn. Ser Hugh had been brusque and uninformative, and arrogant as \nonly a new-made knight can be. If the Hand wished to talk to him, he should be pleased \nto receive him, but he would not be questioned by a mere captain of guards . . . even if \nsaid captain was ten years older and a hundred times the swordsman. The serving girl \nhad at least been pleasant. She said Lord Jon had been reading more than was good for \nhim, that he was troubled and melancholy over his young son\u2019s frailty, and gruff with his \nlady wife.

A few days past, he had taken Ned \naside to show him an exquisite rose gold locklet. Inside was a miniature painted in the \nvivid Myrish style, of a lovely young girl with doe\u2019s eyes and a cascade of soft brown hair. \nRenly had seemed anxious to know if the girl reminded him of anyone, and when Ned \nhad no answer but a shrug, he had seemed disappointed.

Their steel caps and shirts of mail must have been \nsweltering, yet they said no word of complaint. As Lord Eddard passed beneath the \nKing\u2019s Gate into the stink of the city, his grey and white cloak streaming from his \nshoulders, he saw eyes everywhere and kicked his mount into a trot.

A mummer on stilts was striding \nthrough the throngs like some great insect, with a horde of barefoot children trailing \nbehind him, hooting. Elsewhere, two ragged boys no older than Bran were dueling with \nsticks, to the loud encouragement of some and the furious curses of others. An old \nwoman ended the contest by leaning out of her window and emptying a bucket of slops \non the heads of the combatants.

When a column of riders appeared from the west, \nthe guardsmen sprang into action, shouting commands and moving the carts and foot \ntraffic aside to let the knight enter with his escort. The first rider through the gate \ncarried a long black banner. The silk rippled in the wind like a living thing; across the \nfabric was blazoned a night sky slashed with purple lightning. \u201cMake way for Lord \nBeric!\u201d the rider shouted. \u201cMake way for Lord Beric!\u201d And close behind came the young \nlord himself, a dashing figure on a black courser, with red-gold hair and a black satin \ncloak dusted with stars. \u201cHere to fight in the Hand\u2019s tourney, my lord?\u201d a guardsman \ncalled out to him. \u201cHere to win the Hand\u2019s tourney,\u201d Lord Beric shouted back as the \ncrowd cheered.\nNed turned off the square where the Street of Steel began and followed its winding path \nup a long hill, past blacksmiths working at open forges, freeriders haggling over mail \nshirts, and grizzled ironmongers selling old blades and razors from their wagons.

Perhaps the Hand had seen Lord Renly\u2019s new armor, the \ngreen plate with the golden antlers? No other armorer in the city could get that deep a \ngreen; he knew the secret of putting color in the steel itself, paint and enamel were the \ncrutches of a journeyman.

I regret to say, they did not honor me with their \npatronage.\u201d\nNed looked at the man evenly, saying nothing, waiting.

Her father had always given her wise counsel when she needed it most, and \nshe yearned to talk to him, to warn him of the gathering storm. If Winterfell needed to \nbrace for war, how much more so Riverrun, so much closer to King\u2019s Landing, with the \npower of Casterly Rock looming to the west like a shadow. If only her father had been \nstronger, she might have chanced it, but Hoster Tully had been bedridden these past two \nyears, and Catelyn was loath to tax him now.\nThe eastern road was wilder and more dangerous, climbing through rocky foothills and \nthick forests into the Mountains of the Moon, past high passes and deep chasms to the \nVale of Arryn and the stony Fingers beyond. Above the Vale, the Eyrie stood high and \nimpregnable, its towers reaching for the sky. There she would find her sister . . . and, \nperhaps, some of the answers Ned sought. Surely Lysa knew more than she had dared to \nput in her letter. She might have the very proof that Ned needed to bring the Lannisters \nto ruin, and if it came to war, they would need the Arryns and the eastern lords who \nowed them service.\nYet the mountain road was perilous. Shadowcats prowled those passes, rock slides were \ncommon, and the mountain clans were lawless brigands, descending from the heights to \nrob and kill and melting away like snow whenever the knights rode out from the Vale in \nsearch of them. Even Jon Arryn, as great a lord as any the Eyrie had ever known, had \nalways traveled in strength when he crossed the mountains. Catelyn\u2019s only strength was \none elderly knight, armored in loyalty.\nNo, she thought, Riverrun and the Eyrie would have to wait. Her path ran north to \nWinterfell, where her sons and her duty were waiting for her. As soon as they were safely \npast the Neck, she could declare herself to one of Ned\u2019s bannermen, and send riders \nracing ahead with orders to mount a watch on the kingsroad.\nThe rain obscured the fields beyond the crossroads, but Catelyn saw the land clear \nenough in her memory. The marketplace was just across the way, and the village a mile \nfarther on, half a hundred white cottages surrounding a small stone sept. There would be \nmore now; the summer had been long and peaceful. North of here the kingsroad ran \nalong the Green Fork of the Trident, through fertile valleys and green woodlands, past \nthriving towns and stout holdfasts and the castles of the river lords.\nCatelyn knew them all: the Blackwoods and the Brackens, ever enemies, whose quarrels", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2886, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a73321f6-a0cd-4641-a07d-482b415b41e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a73321f6-a0cd-4641-a07d-482b415b41e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "267", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c2aebbc7-c537-4178-91c9-3102aabcc13b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "267", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "hash": "55580ee12c26b55225f2d4e0c601dc0c48eff8ee433e7fbb21b9680eb181815a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "her father was obliged to settle; Lady Whent, last of her line, who dwelt with her ghosts \nin the cavernous vaults of Harrenhal; irascible Lord Frey, who had outlived seven wives \nand filled his twin castles with children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, and \nbastards and grandbastards as well. All of them were bannermen to the Tullys, their \nswords sworn to the service of Riverrun. Catelyn wondered if that would be enough, if it \ncame to war. Her father was the staunchest man who\u2019d ever lived, and she had no doubt \nthat he would call his banners . . . but would the banners come? The Darrys and Rygers \nand Mootons had sworn oaths to Riverrun as well, yet they had fought with Rhaegar \nTargaryen on the Trident, while Lord Frey had arrived with his levies well after the \nbattle was over, leaving some doubt as to which army he had planned to join (theirs, he \nhad assured the victors solemnly in the aftermath, but ever after her father had called \nhim the Late Lord Frey).

They turned the whole \nworld gold. Beyond the city walls, a hundred pavilions had been raised beside the river, \nand the common folk came out in the thousands to watch the games. The splendor of it \nall took Sansa\u2019s breath away; the shining armor, the great chargers caparisoned in silver \nand gold, the shouts of the crowd, the banners snapping in the wind . . . and the knights \nthemselves, the knights most of all.\n\u201cIt is better than the songs,\u201d she whispered when they found the places that her father \nhad promised her, among the high lords and ladies. Sansa was dressed beautifully that \nday, in a green gown that brought out the auburn of her hair, and she knew they were \nlooking at her and smiling.\nThey watched the heroes of a hundred songs ride forth, each more fabulous than the last. \nThe seven knights of the Kingsguard took the field, all but Jaime Lannister in scaled \narmor the color of milk, their cloaks as white as freshfallen snow. Ser Jaime wore the \nwhite cloak as well, but beneath it he was shining gold from head to foot, with a lion\u2019s-\nhead helm and a golden sword. Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain That Rides, \nthundered past them like an avalanche. Sansa remembered Lord Yohn Royce, who had \nguested at Winterfell two years before. \u201cHis armor is bronze, thousands and thousands \nof years old, engraved with magic runes that ward him against harm,\u201d she whispered to \nJeyne. Septa Mordane pointed out Lord Jason Mallister, in indigo chased with silver, the \nwings of an eagle on his helm. He had cut down three of Rhaegar\u2019s bannermen on the \nTrident. The girls giggled over the warrior priest Thoros of Myr, with his flapping red \nrobes and shaven head, until the septa told them that he had once scaled the walls of \nPyke with a flaming sword in hand.\nOther riders Sansa did not know; hedge knights from the Fingers and Highgarden and \nthe mountains of Dorne, unsung freeriders and new-made squires, the younger sons of \nhigh lords and the heirs of lesser houses.

Jory\u2019s armor was blue-grey plate without device or ornament, and a thin grey \ncloak hung from his shoulders like a soiled rag. Yet he acquitted himself well, unhorsing \nHoras Redwyne in his first joust and one of the Freys in his second. In his third match, \nhe rode three passes at a freerider named Lothor Brune whose armor was as drab as his \nown. Neither man lost his seat, but Brune\u2019s lance was steadier and his blows better \nplaced, and the king gave him the victory. Alyn and Harwin fared less well; Harwin was \nunhorsed in his first tilt by Ser Meryn of the Kingsguard, while Alyn fell to Ser Balon \nSwann.\nThe jousting went all day and into the dusk, the hooves of the great warhorses pounding \ndown the lists until the field was a ragged wasteland of torn earth. A dozen times Jeyne \nand Sansa cried out in unison as riders crashed together, lances exploding into splinters \nwhile the commons screamed for their favorites. Jeyne covered her eyes whenever a man \nfell, like a frightened little girl, but Sansa was made of sterner stuff. A great lady knew \nhow to behave at tournaments. Even Septa Mordane noted her composure and nodded \nin approval.\nThe Kingslayer rode brilliantly. He overthrew Ser Andar Royce and the Marcher Lord \nBryce Caron as easily as if he were riding at rings, and then took a hard-fought match \nfrom white-haired Barristan Selmy, who had won his first two tilts against men thirty \nand forty years his junior.\nSandor Clegane and his immense brother, Ser Gregor the Mountain, seemed \nunstoppable as well, riding down one foe after the next in ferocious style.

She had never seen a man die before. She ought to be crying too, she \nthought, but the tears would not come. Perhaps she had used up all her tears for Lady \nand Bran. It would be different if it had been Jory or Ser Rodrik or Father, she told \nherself. The young knight in the blue cloak was nothing to her, some stranger from the \nVale of Arryn whose name she had forgotten as soon as she heard it. And now the world \nwould forget his name too, Sansa realized; there would be no songs sung for him. That \nwas sad.\nAfter they carried off the body, a boy with a spade ran onto the field and shoveled dirt \nover the spot where he had fallen, to cover up the blood. Then the jousts resumed.\nSer Balon Swann also fell to Gregor, and Lord Renly to the Hound. Renly was unhorsed \nso violently that he seemed to fly backward off his charger, legs in the air. His head hit \nthe ground with an audible crack that made the crowd gasp, but it was just the golden \nantler on his helm. One of the tines had snapped off beneath him. When Lord Renly \nclimbed to his feet, the commons cheered wildly, for King Robert\u2019s handsome young \nbrother was a great favorite. He handed the broken tine to his conqueror with a gracious \nbow. The Hound snorted and tossed the broken antler into the crowd, where the \ncommons began to punch and claw over the little bit of gold, until Lord Renly walked out \namong them and restored the peace. By then Septa Mordane had returned, alone. Jeyne \nhad been feeling ill, she explained; she had helped her back to the castle. Sansa had \nalmost forgotten about Jeyne.\nLater a hedge knight in a checkered cloak disgraced himself by killing Beric \nDondarrion\u2019s horse, and was declared forfeit. Lord Beric shifted his saddle to a new \nmount, only to be knocked right off it by Thoros of Myr.

Ser Robar\u2019s ancestral runes \nproved small protection as Ser Loras split his shield and drove him from his saddle to \ncrash with an awful clangor in the dirt. Robar lay moaning as the victor made his circuit \nof the field. Finally they called for a litter and carried him off to his tent, dazed and \nunmoving. Sansa never saw it. Her eyes were only for Ser Loras. When the white horse \nstopped in front of her, she thought her heart would burst.\nTo the other maidens he had given white roses, but the one he plucked for her was red. \n\u201cSweet lady,\u201d he said, \u201cno victory is half so beautiful as you.\u201d Sansa took the flower \ntimidly, struck dumb by his gallantry. His hair was a mass of lazy brown curls, his eyes \nlike liquid gold. She inhaled the sweet fragrance of the rose and sat clutching it long after \nSer Loras had ridden off.\nWhen Sansa finally looked up, a man was standing over her, staring. He was short, with \na pointed beard and a silver streak in his hair, almost as old as her father. \u201cYou must be \none of her daughters,\u201d he said to her.

Do you think he will win tomorrow, my lord?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Joffrey said. \u201cMy dog will do for him, or perhaps my uncle Jaime. And in a few \nyears, when I am old enough to enter the lists, I shall do for them all.\u201d He raised his \nhand to summon a servant with a flagon of iced summerwine, and poured her a cup. She \nlooked anxiously at Septa Mordane, until Joffrey leaned over and filled the septa\u2019s cup as \nwell, so she nodded and thanked him graciously and said not another word.\nThe servants kept the cups filled all night, yet afterward Sansa could not recall ever \ntasting the wine. She needed no wine. She was drunk on the magic of the night, giddy \nwith glamour, swept away by beauties she had dreamt of all her life and never dared \nhope to know. Singers sat before the king\u2019s pavilion, filling the dusk with music. A \njuggler kept a cascade of burning clubs spinning through the air. The king\u2019s own fool, the \npie-faced simpleton called Moon Boy, danced about on stilts, all in motley, making mock \nof everyone with such deft cruelty that Sansa wondered if he was simple after all. Even \nSepta Mordane was helpless before him; when he sang his little song about the High \nSepton, she laughed so hard she spilled wine on herself.\nAnd Joffrey was the soul of courtesy. He talked to Sansa all night, showering her with \ncompliments, making her laugh, sharing little bits of court gossip, explaining Moon \nBoy\u2019s japes. Sansa was so captivated that she quite forgot all her courtesies and ignored \nSepta Mordane, seated to her left.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2807, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9474d3be-a752-457b-bbeb-63faa932ade9": {"__data__": {"id_": "9474d3be-a752-457b-bbeb-63faa932ade9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "278", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5e15c34a-a457-42cf-aed5-1e0b50f95756", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "278", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "hash": "116d435bffd8c92ccb2455880cd09ce0f0524a17b7a5b9fe49ff2c68ef990e01", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "All the while the courses came and went.

Then came trout fresh from the \nriver, baked in clay; her prince helped her crack open the hard casing to expose the flaky \nwhite flesh within.

She was \nwondering whether she might attempt a third when the king began to shout.\nKing Robert had grown louder with each course.

Sansa saw Ser Barristan, and the king\u2019s brother Renly, and the \nshort man who had talked to her so oddly and touched her hair, but no one made a move \nto interfere.

And without even a word of farewell, Joffrey strode off, leaving her there.\nSansa could feel the Hound watching her. \u201cDid you think Joff was going to take you \nhimself?\u201d He laughed.

His nose was large and hooked, his hair thin, dark. He wore it long and \nbrushed it sideways, because no hair grew on the other side of that face.\nThe left side of his face was a ruin. His ear had been burned away; there was nothing left \nbut a hole. His eye was still good, but all around it was a twisted mass of scar, slick black \nflesh hard as leather, pocked with craters and fissured by deep cracks that gleamed red \nand wet when he moved. Down by his jaw, you could see a hint of bone where the flesh \nhad been seared away.\nSansa began to cry. He let go of her then, and snuffed out the torch in the dirt. \u201cNo \npretty words for that, girl? No little compliment the septa taught you?\u201d When there was \nno answer, he continued. \u201cMost of them, they think it was some battle. A siege, a \nburning tower, an enemy with a torch.

A woodcarver set up shop in the \nvillage under my father\u2019s keep, and to buy favor he sent us gifts. The old man made \nmarvelous toys. I don\u2019t remember what I got, but it was Gregor\u2019s gift I wanted. A wooden \nknight, all painted up, every joint pegged separate and fixed with strings, so you could \nmake him fight. Gregor is five years older than me, the toy was nothing to him, he was \nalready a squire, near six foot tall and muscled like an ox. So I took his knight, but there \nwas no joy to it, I tell you. I was scared all the while, and true enough, he found me. \nThere was a brazier in the room. Gregor never said a word, just picked me up under his \narm and shoved the side of my face down in the burning coals and held me there while I \nscreamed and screamed. You saw how strong he is. Even then, it took three grown men \nto drag him off me. The septons preach about the seven hells. What do they know? Only \na man who\u2019s been burned knows what hell is truly like.\n\u201cMy father told everyone my bedding had caught fire, and our maester gave me \nointments. Ointments! Gregor got his ointments too. Four years later, they anointed him \nwith the seven oils and he recited his knightly vows and Rhaegar Targaryen tapped him \non the shoulder and said, \u2018Arise, Ser Gregor.\u2019 \u201d\nThe rasping voice trailed off. He squatted silently before her, a hulking black shape \nshrouded in the night, hidden from her eyes. Sansa could hear his ragged breathing. She \nwas sad for him, she realized. Somehow, the fear had gone away.\nThe silence went on and on, so long that she began to grow afraid once more, but she \nwas afraid for him now, not for herself. She found his massive shoulder with her hand. \n\u201cHe was no true knight,\u201d she whispered to him.\nThe Hound threw back his head and roared. Sansa stumbled back, away from him, but \nhe caught her arm. \u201cNo,\u201d he growled at her, \u201cno, little bird, he was no true knight.\u201d\nThe rest of the way into the city, Sandor Clegane said not a word. He led her to where the \ncarts were waiting, told a driver to take them back to the Red Keep, and climbed in after \nher.

Cersei Lannister would be a good match, he told me, she \nwould bind Lord Tywin to me should Viserys Targaryen ever try to win back his father\u2019s \nthrone.\u201d The king shook his head. \u201cI loved that old man, I swear it, but now I think he \nwas a bigger fool than Moon Boy. Oh, Cersei is lovely to look at, truly, but cold . . . the \nway she guards her cunt, you\u2019d think she had all the gold of Casterly Rock between her \nlegs. Here, give me that beer if you won\u2019t drink it.\u201d He took the horn, upended it, \nbelched, wiped his mouth. \u201cI am sorry for your girl, Ned. Truly. About the wolf, I mean. \nMy son was lying, I\u2019d stake my soul on it. My son . . . you love your children, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cWith all my heart,\u201d Ned said.\n\u201cLet me tell you a secret, Ned. More than once, I have dreamed of giving up the crown. \nTake ship for the Free Cities with my horse and my hammer, spend my time warring and \nwhoring, that\u2019s what I was made for. The sellsword king, how the singers would love me. \nYou know what stops me? The thought of Joffrey on the throne, with Cersei standing \nbehind him whispering in his ear. My son. How could I have made a son like that, Ned?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s only a boy,\u201d Ned said awkwardly. He had small liking for Prince Joffrey, but he \ncould hear the pain in Robert\u2019s voice. \u201cHave you forgotten how wild you were at his age?\u201d\n\u201cIt would not trouble me if the boy was wild, Ned. You don\u2019t know him as I do.\u201d He \nsighed and shook his head. \u201cAh, perhaps you are right. Jon despaired of me often \nenough, yet I grew into a good king.\u201d Robert looked at Ned and scowled at his silence. \n\u201cYou might speak up and agree now, you know.\u201d\n\u201cYour Grace . . . \u201d Ned began, carefully.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2423, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f775ccac-5b34-40c0-bb70-97e5af20f868": {"__data__": {"id_": "f775ccac-5b34-40c0-bb70-97e5af20f868", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "288", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bdf52b9e-a7e3-49f5-99b7-4fe8cae60dfe", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "288", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "hash": "6dc9d3c9a4b388b8ac35818d2422bb22e4d1a7dd41018ead394fa45a676e95d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Robert slapped Ned on the back. \u201cAh, say that I\u2019m a better king than Aerys and be done \nwith it.

He was soon to be married for the third time, and one heard \ndark whisperings about the deaths of his first two wives.

They cheered him as \nhe left the lists to return to his pavilion.\nAs Ned walked with Sansa to the archery field, Littlefinger and Lord Renly and some of \nthe others fell in with them. \u201cTyrell had to know the mare was in heat,\u201d Littlefinger was \nsaying. \u201cI swear the boy planned the whole thing.

Ned sent Alyn to seek him out and offer him a position with the Hand\u2019s guard, \nbut the boy was flush with wine and victory and riches undreamed of, and he refused.\nThe melee went on for three hours. Near forty men took part, freeriders and hedge \nknights and new-made squires in search of a reputation. They fought with blunted \nweapons in a chaos of mud and blood, small troops fighting together and then turning \non each other as alliances formed and fractured, until only one man was left standing. \nThe victor was the red priest, Thoros of Myr, a madman who shaved his head and fought \nwith a flaming sword. He had won melees before; the fire sword frightened the mounts \nof the other riders, and nothing frightened Thoros. The final tally was three broken \nlimbs, a shattered collarbone, a dozen smashed fingers, two horses that had to be put \ndown, and more cuts, sprains, and bruises than anyone cared to count. Ned was \ndesperately pleased that Robert had not taken part.\nThat night at the feast, Eddard Stark was more hopeful than he had been in a great \nwhile. Robert was in high good humor, the Lannisters were nowhere to be seen, and \neven his daughters were behaving. Jory brought Arya down to join them, and Sansa \nspoke to her sister pleasantly. \u201cThe tournament was magnificent,\u201d she sighed. \u201cYou \nshould have come. How was your dancing?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sore all over,\u201d Arya reported happily, proudly displaying a huge purple bruise on \nher leg.\n\u201cYou must be a terrible dancer,\u201d Sansa said doubtfully.\nLater, while Sansa was off listening to a troupe of singers perform the complex round of \ninterwoven ballads called the \u201cDance of the Dragons,\u201d Ned inspected the bruise himself. \n\u201cI hope Forel is not being too hard on you,\u201d he said.\nArya stood on one leg. She was getting much better at that of late. \u201cSyrio says that every \nhurt is a lesson, and every lesson makes you better.\u201d\nNed frowned. The man Syrio Forel had come with an excellent reputation, and his \nflamboyant Braavosi style was well suited to Arya\u2019s slender blade, yet still . . . a few days \nago, she had been wandering around with a swatch of black silk tied over her eyes.

The day had been warm and the room was close \nand stuffy. Ned went to the window and unfastened the heavy shutters to let in the cool \nnight air. Across the Great Yard, he noticed the flickering glow of candlelight from \nLittlefinger\u2019s windows. The hour was well past midnight. Down by the river, the revels \nwere only now beginning to dwindle and die.\nHe took out the dagger and studied it. Littlefinger\u2019s blade, won by Tyrion Lannister in a \ntourney wager, sent to slay Bran in his sleep. Why? Why would the dwarf want Bran \ndead? Why would anyone want Bran dead?\nThe dagger, Bran\u2019s fall, all of it was linked somehow to the murder of Jon Arryn, he \ncould feel it in his gut, but the truth of Jon\u2019s death remained as clouded to him as when \nhe had started. Lord Stannis had not returned to King\u2019s Landing for the tourney. Lysa \nArryn held her silence behind the high walls of the Eyrie. The squire was dead, and Jory \nwas still searching the whorehouses. What did he have but Robert\u2019s bastard?\nThat the armorer\u2019s sullen apprentice was the king\u2019s son, Ned had no doubt. The \nBaratheon look was stamped on his face, in his jaw, his eyes, that black hair.

Trying to cut their way out of this was a sure invitation to \nan early grave.

Oh, the Stark woman \nhad been clever, no doubt of it. Force them to make a public affirmation of the oaths \nsworn her father by the lords they served, and then call on them for succor, and her a \nwoman, yes, that was sweet.

Quiet? The old fool. Unless he took the whole \ninn, the word would begin to spread the instant they were gone.

That fool singer might make a lay of it. \nThe Freys would report back to their lord, and the gods only knew what he might do. \nLord Walder Frey might be sworn to Riverrun, but he was a cautious man who had lived \na long time by making certain he was always on the winning side. At the very least he \nwould send his birds winging south to King\u2019s Landing, and he might well dare more than \nthat.\nCatelyn Stark wasted no time. \u201cWe must ride at once.

Every twist and turn put him \nin danger of falling off his horse. The hood muffled sound, so he could not make out \nwhat was being said around him, and the rain soaked through the cloth and made it \ncling to his face, until even breathing was a struggle. The rope chafed his wrists raw and \nseemed to grow tighter as the night wore on.

Tyrion \nwondered whether the boy would think the adventure quite so splendid once the \nLannister riders caught up with them.\nThe rain had finally stopped and dawn light was seeping through the wet cloth over his \neyes when Catelyn Stark gave the command to dismount. Rough hands pulled him down \nfrom his horse, untied his wrists, and yanked the hood off his head. When he saw the \nnarrow stony road, the foothills rising high and wild all around them, and the jagged \nsnowcapped peaks on the distant horizon, all the hope went out of him in a rush. \u201cThis is \nthe high road,\u201d he gasped, looking at Lady Stark with accusation. \u201cThe eastern road. You \nsaid we were riding for Winterfell!\u201d\nCatelyn Stark favored him with the faintest of smiles. \u201cOften and loudly,\u201d she agreed. \n\u201cNo doubt your friends will ride that way when they come after us. I wish them good \nspeed.\u201d\nEven now, long days later, the memory filled him with a bitter rage. All his life Tyrion \nhad prided himself on his cunning, the only gift the gods had seen fit to give him, and yet \nthis seven-times-damned she-wolf Catelyn Stark had outwitted him at every turn. The \nknowledge was more galling than the bare fact of his abduction.\nThey stopped only as long as it took to feed and water the horses, and then they were off \nagain.

Chiggen\u2019s \nsword raked across the naked face of a mailed rider, and Bronn plunged through the \nclansmen like a whirlwind, cutting down foes right and left. Ser Rodrik hammered at the \nbig man in the shadowskin cloak, their horses dancing round each other as they traded \nblow for blow. Jyck vaulted onto a horse and galloped bareback into the fray. Tyrion saw \nan arrow sprout from the throat of the man in the shadowskin cloak. When he opened \nhis mouth to scream, only blood came out.

Tyrion scrambled to his feet as the rider turned to come back at them, hefting \na spiked maul. Tyrion swung his axe with both hands. The blade caught the charging \nhorse in the throat with a meaty thunk, angling upward, and Tyrion almost lost his grip \nas the animal screamed and collapsed.

Somehow the \nfighting had ended when he wasn\u2019t looking. Dying horses and wounded men lay all \naround, screaming or moaning. To his vast astonishment, he was not one of them.

Robert had left \nhim no choice that he could see. He ought to thank him. It would be good to return to \nWinterfell. He ought never have left. His sons were waiting there. Perhaps he and \nCatelyn would make a new son together when he returned, they were not so old yet. And \nof late he had often found himself dreaming of snow, of the deep quiet of the wolfswood \nat night.\nAnd yet, the thought of leaving angered him as well. So much was still undone. Robert \nand his council of cravens and flatterers would beggar the realm if left unchecked . . . or, \nworse, sell it to the Lannisters in payment of their loans. And the truth of Jon Arryn\u2019s \ndeath still eluded him. Oh, he had found a few pieces, enough to convince him that Jon \nhad indeed been murdered, but that was no more than the spoor of an animal on the \nforest floor. He had not sighted the beast itself yet, though he sensed it was there, \nlurking, hidden, treacherous.\nIt struck him suddenly that he might return to Winterfell by sea. Ned was no sailor, and \nordinarily would have preferred the kingsroad, but if he took ship he could stop at \nDragonstone and speak with Stannis Baratheon. Pycelle had sent a raven off across the \nwater, with a polite letter from Ned requesting Lord Stannis to return to his seat on the \nsmall council. As yet, there had been no reply, but the silence only deepened his \nsuspicions. Lord Stannis shared the secret Jon Arryn had died for, he was certain of it. \nThe truth he sought might very well be waiting for him on the ancient island fortress of \nHouse Targaryen.\nAnd when you have it, what then? Some secrets are safer kept hidden. Some secrets are \ntoo dangerous to share, even with those you love and trust. Ned slid the dagger that \nCatelyn had brought him out of the sheath on his belt. The Imp\u2019s knife. Why would the \ndwarf want Bran dead? To silence him, surely. Another secret, or only a different strand \nof the same web?\nCould Robert be part of it? He would not have thought so, but once he would not have \nthought Robert could command the murder of women and children either. Catelyn had \ntried to warn him. You knew the man, she had said. The king is a stranger to you. The \nsooner he was quit of King\u2019s Landing, the better. If there was a ship sailing north on the \nmorrow, it would be well to be on it.\nHe summoned Vayon Poole again and sent him to the docks to make inquiries, quietly \nbut quickly. \u201cFind me a fast ship with a skilled captain,\u201d he told the steward. \u201cI care \nnothing for the size of its cabins or the quality of its appointments, so long as it is swift \nand safe.

On the far side of the \nstoneworks, the mountains opened up suddenly upon a vista of green fields, blue sky, \nand snowcapped mountains that took her breath away. The Vale of Arryn bathed in the \nmorning light.\nIt stretched before them to the misty cast, a tranquil land of rich black soil, wide slow-\nmoving rivers, and hundreds of small lakes that shone like mirrors in the sun, protected \non all sides by its sheltering peaks. Wheat and corn and barley grew high in its fields, \nand even in Highgarden the pumpkins were no larger nor the fruit any sweeter than \nhere. They stood at the western end of the valley, where the high road crested the last \npass and began its winding descent to the bottomlands two miles below. The Vale was \nnarrow here, no more than a half day\u2019s ride across, and the northern mountains seemed \nso close that Catelyn could almost reach out and touch them. Looming over them all was \nthe jagged peak called the Giant\u2019s Lance, a mountain that even mountains looked up to, \nits head lost in icy mists three and a half miles above the valley floor. Over its massive \nwestern shoulder flowed the ghost torrent of Alyssa\u2019s Tears. Even from this distance, \nCatelyn could make out the shining silver thread, bright against the dark stone.\nWhen her uncle saw that she had stopped, he moved his horse closer and pointed. \u201cIt\u2019s \nthere, beside Alyssa\u2019s Tears.

Yet for all that, Catelyn misliked the man. Courage he \nhad, and strength, but there was no kindness in him, and little loyalty. And she had seen \nhim riding beside Lannister far too often, talking in low voices and laughing at some \nprivate joke. She would have preferred to separate him from the dwarf here and now, \nbut having agreed that Marillion might continue to the Eyrie, she could see no gracious \nway to deny that same right to Bronn. \u201cAs you wish,\u201d she said, although she noted that \nhe had not actually asked her permission.\nSer Willis Wode remained with Ser Rodrik, a soft-spoken septon fussing over their \nwounds.

Fresh mounts were brought forth from the stables, surefooted mountain stock \nwith shaggy coats, and within the hour they set forth once again.

It was at their wedding \nfeast that Brynden told his brother he was leaving Riverrun to serve Lysa and her new \nhusband, the Lord of the Eyrie. Lord Hoster had not spoken his brother\u2019s name since, \nfrom what Edmure told her in his infrequent letters.\nNonetheless, during all those years of Catelyn\u2019s girlhood, it had been Brynden the \nBlackfish to whom Lord Hoster\u2019s children had run with their tears and their tales, when \nFather was too busy and Mother too ill.

Then \nshe noticed the glow of distant fires well above them; a tower keep, built upon the steep \nside of the mountain, its lights like orange eyes staring down from above. Above that was \nanother, higher and more distant, and still higher a third, no more than a flickering \nspark in the sky. And finally, up where the falcons soared, a flash of white in the \nmoonlight. Vertigo washed over her as she stared upward at the pale towers, so far \nabove.\n\u201cThe Eyrie,\u201d she heard Marillion murmur, awed.\nThe sharp voice of Tyrion Lannister broke in. \u201cThe Arryns must not be overfond of \ncompany.

Ned had told her about them \nwhen he talked of his youth here with Robert Baratheon and Jon Arryn.\nHer uncle nodded. \u201cIt is too dark to see them, but the steps are there. Too steep and \nnarrow for horses, but mules can manage them most of the way. The path is guarded by \nthree waycastles, Stone and Snow and Sky. The mules will take us as far up as Sky.\u201d\nTyrion Lannister glanced up doubtfully. \u201cAnd beyond that?\u201d\nBrynden smiled. \u201cBeyond that, the path is too steep even for mules. We ascend on foot \nthe rest of the way. Or perchance you\u2019d prefer to ride a basket. The Eyrie clings to the \nmountain directly above Sky, and in its cellars are six great winches with long iron \nchains to draw supplies up from below. If you prefer, my lord of Lannister, I can arrange \nfor you to ride up with the bread and beer and apples.\u201d\nThe dwarf gave a bark of laughter. \u201cWould that I were a pumpkin,\u201d he said. \u201cAlas, my \nlord father would no doubt be most chagrined if his son of Lannister went to his fate like \na load of turnips.

The trees pressed close, leaning over \nthe path to make a rustling green roof that shut out even the moon, so it seemed as \nthough they were moving up a long black tunnel. But the mules were surefooted and \ntireless, and Mya Stone did indeed seem blessed with night-eyes. They plodded upward, \nwinding their way back and forth across the face of the mountain as the steps twisted \nand turned. A thick layer of fallen needles carpeted the path, so the shoes of their mules \nmade only the softest sound on the rock. The quiet soothed her, and the gentle rocking \nmotion set Catelyn to swaying in her saddle. Before long she was fighting sleep.\nPerhaps she did doze for a moment, for suddenly a massive ironbound gate was looming \nbefore them. \u201cStone,\u201d Mya announced cheerily, dismounting. Iron spikes were set along \nthe tops of formidable stone walls, and two fat round towers overtopped the keep. The \ngate swung open at Mya\u2019s shout. Inside, the portly knight who commanded the \nwaycastle greeted Mya by name and offered them skewers of charred meat and onions \nstill hot from the spit. Catelyn had not realized how hungry she was. She ate standing in \nthe yard, as stablehands moved their saddles to fresh mules. The hot juices ran down her \nchin and dripped onto her cloak, but she was too famished to care.\nThen it was up onto a new mule and out again into the starlight. The second part of the \nascent seemed more treacherous to Catelyn. The trail was steeper, the steps more worn, \nand here and there littered with pebbles and broken stone. Mya had to dismount a half-\ndozen times to move fallen rocks from their path. \u201cYou don\u2019t want your mule to break a \nleg up here,\u201d she said. Catelyn was forced to agree. She could feel the altitude more now. \nThe trees were sparser up here, and the wind blew more vigorously, sharp gusts that \ntugged at her clothing and pushed her hair into her eyes. From time to time the steps \ndoubled back on themselves, and she could see Stone below them, and the Gates of the \nMoon farther down, its torches no brighter than candles.\nSnow was smaller than Stone, a single fortified tower and a timber keep and stable \nhidden behind a low wall of unmortared rock. Yet it nestled against the Giant\u2019s Lance in \nsuch a way as to command the entire stone stair above the lower waycastle. An enemy \nintent on the Eyrie would have to fight his way from Stone step by step, while rocks and \narrows rained down from Snow above. The commander, an anxious young knight with a \npockmarked face, offered bread and cheese and the chance to warm themselves before \nhis fire, but Mya declined. \u201cWe ought to keep going, my lady,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it please you.\u201d \nCatelyn nodded.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3108, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a422caf2-ad54-4dff-b258-d9d8347e5ecf": {"__data__": {"id_": "a422caf2-ad54-4dff-b258-d9d8347e5ecf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "343", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2a803187-a717-4420-b0d6-5db651971321", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "343", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "hash": "282f59588a08d9b81e7b19874956d0320e00851d40914bdc69b86762d7248c02", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Again they were given fresh mules.

Perhaps she was \nbecoming a Stark at last.\nAbove Snow, the wind was a living thing, howling around them like a wolf in the waste, \nthen falling off to nothing as if to lure them into complacency.

Yet no sooner had she taken her first step than fear \ncaught Catelyn in its jaws. She could feel the emptiness, the vast black gulfs of air that \nyawned around her. She stopped, trembling, afraid to move. The wind screamed at her \nand wrenched at her cloak, trying to pull her over the edge. Catelyn edged her foot \nbackward, the most timid of steps, but the mule was behind her, and she could not \nretreat. I am going to die here, she thought. She could feel cold sweat trickling down her \nback.\n\u201cLady Stark,\u201d Mya called across the gulf.

She listened to the skirling of \nthe wind and the scuffling sound of leather on stone. Then Mya was there, taking her \ngently by the arm. \u201cKeep your eyes closed if you like. Let go of the rope now, Whitey will \ntake care of himself. Very good, my lady. I\u2019ll lead you over, it\u2019s easy, you\u2019ll see. Give me a \nstep now.

Here at last the snow crown \nbegan; Sky\u2019s weathered stones were rimed with frost, and long spears of ice hung from \nthe slopes above.\nDawn was breaking in the east as Mya Stone hallooed for the guards, and the gates \nopened before them. Inside the walls there was only a series of ramps and a great tumble \nof boulders and stones of all sizes. No doubt it would be the easiest thing in the world to \nbegin an avalanche from here. A mouth yawned in the rock face in front of them. \u201cThe \nstables and barracks are in there,\u201d Mya said. \u201cThe last part is inside the mountain. It can \nbe a little dark, but at least you\u2019re out of the wind. This is as far as the mules can go.

Directly overhead, pale in the dawn light, she could see the \nfoundations of the Eyrie. It could not be more than six hundred feet above them. From \nbelow it looked like a small white honeycomb. She remembered what her uncle had said \nof baskets and winches. \u201cThe Lannisters may have their pride,\u201d she told Mya, \u201cbut the \nTullys are born with better sense. I have ridden all day and the best part of a night. Tell \nthem to lower a basket. I shall ride with the turnips.\u201d\nThe sun was well above the mountains by the time Catelyn Stark finally reached the \nEyrie. A stocky, silver-haired man in a sky-blue cloak and hammered moon-and-falcon \nbreastplate helped her from the basket; Ser Vardis Egen, captain of Jon Arryn\u2019s \nhousehold guard.

The Eyrie was a small castle \nby the standards of the great houses; seven slender white towers bunched as tightly as \narrows in a quiver on a shoulder of the great mountain. It had no need of stables nor \nsmithys nor kennels, but Ned said its granary was as large as Winterfell\u2019s, and its towers \ncould house five hundred men. Yet it seemed strangely deserted to Catelyn as she passed \nthrough it, its pale stone halls echoing and empty.\nLysa was waiting alone in her solar, still clad in her bed robes. Her long auburn hair \ntumbled unbound across bare white shoulders and down her back. A maid stood behind \nher, brushing out the night\u2019s tangles, but when Catelyn entered, her sister rose to her \nfeet, smiling. \u201cCat,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, Cat, how good it is to see you.

They had taken their toll. Her \nsister was two years the younger, yet she looked older now. Shorter than Catelyn, Lysa \nhad grown thick of body, pale and puffy of face. She had the blue eyes of the Tullys, but \nhers were pale and watery, never still. Her small mouth had turned petulant. As Catelyn \nheld her, she remembered the slender, high-breasted girl who\u2019d waited beside her that \nday in the sept at Riverrun. How lovely and full of hope she had been. All that remained \nof her sister\u2019s beauty was the great fall of thick auburn hair that cascaded to her waist.\n\u201cYou look well,\u201d Catelyn lied, \u201cbut . . . tired.\u201d\nHer sister broke the embrace. \u201cTired.

Around the hall were broad grassy horse yards fenced with high hedges, \nfirepits, and hundreds of round earthen houses that bulged from the ground like \nminiature hills, covered with grass.\nA small army of slaves had gone ahead to prepare for Khal Drogo\u2019s arrival. As each rider \nswung down from his saddle, he unbelted his arakh and handed it to a waiting slave, \nand any other weapons he carried as well. Even Khal Drogo himself was not exempt. Ser \nJorah had explained that it was forbidden to carry a blade in Vaes Dothrak, or to shed a \nfree man\u2019s blood. Even warring khalasars put aside their feuds and shared meat and \nmead together when they were in sight of the Mother of Mountains.

He was the \noldest of Drogo\u2019s three bloodriders, a squat bald man with a crooked nose and a mouth \nfull of broken teeth, shattered by a mace twenty years before when he saved the young \nkhalakka from sellswords who hoped to sell him to his father\u2019s enemies.

The ancient traditions of the horselords demanded that when the khal died, \nhis bloodriders died with him, to ride at his side in the night lands. If the khal died at the \nhands of some enemy, they lived only long enough to avenge him, and then followed him \njoyfully into the grave. In some khalasars, Jhiqui said, the bloodriders shared the khal\u2019s \nwine, his tent, and even his wives, though never his horses. A man\u2019s mount was his own.\nDaenerys was glad that Khal Drogo did not hold to those ancient ways. She should not \nhave liked being shared. And while old Cohollo treated her kindly enough, the others \nfrightened her; Haggo, huge and silent, often glowered as if he had forgotten who she \nwas, and Qotho had cruel eyes and quick hands that liked to hurt. He left bruises on \nDoreah\u2019s soft white skin whenever he touched her, and sometimes made Irri sob in the \nnight. Even his horses seemed to fear him.\nYet they were bound to Drogo for life and death, so Daenerys had no choice but to accept \nthem. And sometimes she found herself wishing her father had been protected by such \nmen. In the songs, the white knights of the Kingsguard were ever noble, valiant, and \ntrue, and yet King Aerys had been murdered by one of them, the handsome boy they \nnow called the Kingslayer, and a second, Ser Barristan the Bold, had gone over to the \nUsurper. She wondered if all men were as false in the Seven Kingdoms. When her son \nsat the Iron Throne, she would see that he had bloodriders of his own to protect him \nagainst treachery in his Kingsguard.\n\u201cKhaleesi,\u201d Cohollo said to her, in Dothraki. \u201cDrogo, who is blood of my blood, \ncommands me to tell you that he must ascend the Mother of Mountains this night, to \nsacrifice to the gods for his safe return.\u201d\nOnly men were allowed to set foot on the Mother, Dany knew. The khal\u2019s bloodriders \nwould go with him, and return at dawn. \u201cTell my sun-and-stars that I dream of him, and \nwait anxious for his return,\u201d she replied, thankful. Dany tired more easily as the child \ngrew within her; in truth, a night of rest would be most welcome. Her pregnancy only \nseemed to have inflamed Drogo\u2019s desire for her, and of late his embraces left her \nexhausted.\nDoreah led her to the hollow hill that had been prepared for her and her khal. It was cool \nand dim within, like a tent made of earth. \u201cJhiqui, a bath, please,\u201d she commanded, to \nwash the dust of travel from her skin and soak her weary bones.

Theon spurred his mount to move up beside Robb. \u201cSweet Kyra,\u201d he said with a \nlaugh. \u201cShe squirms like a weasel in bed, but say a word to her on the street, and she \nblushes pink as a maid. Did I ever tell you about the night that she and Bessa\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNot where my brother can hear, Theon,\u201d Robb warned him with a glance at Bran.\nBran looked away and pretended not to have heard, but he could feel Greyjoy\u2019s eyes on \nhim. No doubt he was smiling. He smiled a lot, as if the world were a secret joke that \nonly he was clever enough to understand. Robb seemed to admire Theon and enjoy his \ncompany, but Bran had never warmed to his father\u2019s ward.\nRobb rode closer. \u201cYou are doing well, Bran.\u201d\n\u201cI want to go faster,\u201d Bran replied.\nRobb smiled. \u201cAs you will.\u201d He sent his gelding into a trot. The wolves raced after him. \nBran snapped the reins sharply, and Dancer picked up her pace. He heard a shout from \nTheon Greyjoy, and the hoofbeats of the other horses behind him.\nBran\u2019s cloak billowed out, rippling in the wind, and the snow seemed to rush at his face. \nRobb was well ahead, glancing back over his shoulder from time to time to make sure \nBran and the others were following. He snapped the reins again. Smooth as silk, Dancer \nslid into a gallop. The distance closed.

There was a bird last night. From King\u2019s Landing. Maester Luwin woke me.\u201d\nBran felt a sudden dread. Dark wings, dark words, Old Nan always said, and of late the \nmessenger ravens had been proving the truth of the proverb. When Robb wrote to the \nLord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch, the bird that came back brought word that Uncle \nBenjen was still missing. Then a message had arrived from the Eyrie, from Mother, but \nthat had not been good news either. She did not say when she meant to return, only that \nshe had taken the Imp as prisoner. Bran had sort of liked the little man, yet the name \nLannister sent cold fingers creeping up his spine. There was something about the \nLannisters, something he ought to remember, but when he tried to think what, he felt \ndizzy and his stomach clenched hard as a stone. Robb spent most of that day locked \nbehind closed doors with Maester Luwin, Theon Greyjoy, and Hallis Mollen. Afterward, \nriders were sent out on fast horses, carrying Robb\u2019s commands throughout the north. \nBran heard talk of Moat Cailin, the ancient stronghold the First Men had built at the top \nof the Neck. No one ever told him what was happening, yet he knew it was not good.\nAnd now another raven, another message. Bran clung to hope. \u201cWas the bird from \nMother? Is she coming home?\u201d\n\u201cThe message was from Alyn in King\u2019s Landing. Jory Cassel is dead. And Wyl and \nHeward as well. Murdered by the Kingslayer.\u201d Robb lifted his face to the snow, and the \nflakes melted on his cheeks. \u201cMay the gods give them rest.\u201d\nBran did not know what to say.

He fell back into the \nstream with a splash and a shout, flailing wildly with his knife as his head went under. \nThe direwolf plunged in after him, and the white water turned red where they had \nvanished.\nRobb and Osha matched blows in midstream.

On the fourth or fifth thrust, the tall woman \noverextended herself and lost her balance, just for a second. Robb charged, riding her \ndown.\nA few feet away, Summer darted in and snapped at Hali. The knife bit at his flank. \nSummer slid away, snarling, and came rushing in again. This time his jaws closed \naround her calf.

He shook the water \noff and bounded after the running man, hamstringing him with a single snap of his \nteeth, and going for the throat as the screaming man slid back down toward the water.\nAnd then there was no one left but the big man, Stiv.

Jaime might be \nleading a host through the Mountains of the Moon even now . . . unless he was riding \nnorth against Winterfell instead. Did anyone outside the Vale even suspect where \nCatelyn Stark had taken him? He wondered what Cersei would do when she heard. The \nking could order him freed, but would Robert listen to his queen or his Hand? Tyrion \nhad no illusions about the king\u2019s love for his sister.\nIf Cersei kept her wits about her, she would insist the king sit in judgment of Tyrion \nhimself. Even Ned Stark could scarcely object to that, not without impugning the honor \nof the king. And Tyrion would be only too glad to take his chances in a trial. Whatever \nmurders they might lay at his door, the Starks had no proof of anything so far as he \ncould see. Let them make their case before the Iron Throne and the lords of the land. It \nwould be the end of them. If only Cersei were clever enough to see that . . . \nTyrion Lannister sighed. His sister was not without a certain low cunning, but her pride \nblinded her. She would see the insult in this, not the opportunity. And Jaime was even \nworse, rash and headstrong and quick to anger. His brother never untied a knot when he \ncould slash it in two with his sword.\nHe wondered which of them had sent the footpad to silence the Stark boy, and whether \nthey had truly conspired at the death of Lord Arryn. If the old Hand had been murdered, \nit was deftly and subtly done. Men of his age died of sudden illness all the time.

Below her the world turned from black to indigo to \ngreen as dawn crept across fields and forests. Pale white mists rose off Alyssa\u2019s Tears, \nwhere the ghost waters plunged over the shoulder of the mountain to begin their long \ntumble down the face of the Giant\u2019s Lance.

So in death, the gods had decreed that she would know no \nrest until her weeping watered the black earth of the Vale, where the men she had loved \nwere buried. Alyssa had been dead six thousand years now, and still no drop of the \ntorrent had ever reached the valley floor far below.

Pitchers of thick cream \nand baskets of blackberries had been set out, and the guests were sipping a sweet orange-\nscented wine from engraved silver cups.

They were the suitors who stood \nhighest in Lysa\u2019s favor . . . today, at least. Catelyn would have been hard-pressed to say \nwhich man was more unsuitable.

Large circular rondels, enameled cream-and-blue in the moon-and-\nfalcon sigil of House Arryn, protected the vulnerable juncture of arm and breast. A skirt \nof lobstered metal covered him from waist to midthigh, while a solid gorget encircled his \nthroat. Falcon\u2019s wings sprouted from the temples of his helm, and his visor was a \npointed metal beak with a narrow slit for vision.\nBronn was so lightly armored he looked almost naked beside the knight. He wore only a \nshirt of black oiled ringmail over boiled leather, a round steel halfhelm with a \nnoseguard, and a mail coif. High leather boots with steel shinguards gave some \nprotection to his legs, and discs of black iron were sewn into the fingers of his gloves. Yet \nCatelyn noted that the sellsword stood half a hand taller than his foe, with a longer \nreach . . . and Bronn was fifteen years younger, if she was any judge.\nThey knelt in the grass beneath the weeping woman, facing each other, with Lannister \nbetween them. The septon removed a faceted crystal sphere from the soft cloth bag at his \nwaist. He lifted it high above his head, and the light shattered. Rainbows danced across \nthe Imp\u2019s face. In a high, solemn, singsong voice, the septon asked the gods to look down \nand bear witness, to find the truth in this man\u2019s soul, to grant him life and freedom if he \nwas innocent, death if he was guilty.

The different metals are each a different \nkind of learning, gold for the study of money and accounts, silver for healing, iron for \nwarcraft. And he said there were other meanings as well. The collar is supposed to \nremind a maester of the realm he serves, isn\u2019t that so? Lords are gold and knights steel, \nbut two links can\u2019t make a chain. You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper \nand bronze and all the rest, and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the \nlike.

Still, you\u2019re not stupid. \nOnce we reached the Vale, Lady Stark had no more need of you . . . but I did, and the one \nthing the Lannisters have never lacked for is gold.

What do you want, \nBronn? Gold? Land? Women? Keep me alive, and you\u2019ll have it.\u201d\nBronn blew gently on the fire, and the flames leapt up higher. \u201cAnd if you die?\u201d\n\u201cWhy then, I\u2019ll have one mourner whose grief is sincere,\u201d Tyrion said, grinning. \u201cThe \ngold ends when I do.\u201d\nThe fire was blazing up nicely. Bronn stood, tucked the flint back into his pouch, and \ntossed Tyrion his dagger. \u201cFair enough,\u201d he said. \u201cMy sword\u2019s yours, then . . . but don\u2019t \ngo looking for me to bend the knee and m\u2019lord you every time you take a shit.

If the day ever comes when you\u2019re tempted to sell me \nout, remember this, Bronn\u2014I\u2019ll match their price, whatever it is. I like living.

How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?\u201d\n\u201cIn my own bed, with a belly full of wine and a maiden\u2019s mouth around my cock, at the \nage of eighty,\u201d he replied.\nThe huge one, Shagga, laughed first and loudest. The others seemed less amused. \u201cConn, \ntake their horses,\u201d Gunthor commanded. \u201cKill the other and seize the halfinan. He can \nmilk the goats and make the mothers laugh.\u201d\nBronn sprang to his feet. \u201cWho dies first?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Tyrion said sharply. \u201cGunthor son of Gurn, hear me. My House is rich and \npowerful. If the Stone Crows will see us safely through these mountains, my lord father \nwill shower you with gold.\u201d\n\u201cThe gold of a lowland lord is as worthless as a halfman\u2019s promises,\u201d Gunthor said.\n\u201cHalf a man I may be,\u201d Tyrion said, \u201cyet I have the courage to face my enemies. What do \nthe Stone Crows do, but hide behind rocks and shiver with fear as the knights of the Vale \nride by?\u201d\nShagga gave a roar of anger and clashed club against axe. Jaggot poked at Tyrion\u2019s face \nwith the fire-hardened point of a long wooden spear. He did his best not to flinch. \u201cAre \nthese the best weapons you could steal?\u201d he said. \u201cGood enough for killing sheep, \nperhaps . . . if the sheep do not fight back.

Now the stone was covered with hunting tapestries, vivid with \ngreens and browns and blues, and yet still it seemed to Ned Stark that the only color in \nthe hall was the red of blood.\nHe sat high upon the immense ancient seat of Aegon the Conqueror, an ironwork \nmonstrosity of spikes and jagged edges and grotesquely twisted metal. It was, as Robert \nhad warned him, a hellishly uncomfortable chair, and never more so than now, with his \nshattered leg throbbing more sharply every minute. The metal beneath him had grown \nharder by the hour, and the fanged steel behind made it impossible to lean back. A king \nshould never sit easy, Aegon the Conqueror had said, when he commanded his armorers \nto forge a great seat from the swords laid down by his enemies. Damn Aegon for his \narrogance, Ned thought sullenly, and damn Robert and his hunting as well.\n\u201cYou are quite certain these were more than brigands?\u201d Varys asked softly from the \ncouncil table beneath the throne. Grand Maester Pycelle stirred uneasily beside him, \nwhile Littlefinger toyed with a pen. They were the only councillors in attendance. A \nwhite hart had been sighted in the kingswood, and Lord Renly and Ser Barristan had \njoined the king to hunt it, along with Prince Joffrey, Sandor Clegane, Balon Swann, and \nhalf the court. So Ned must needs sit the Iron Throne in his absence.\nAt least he could sit. Save the council, the rest must stand respectfully, or kneel. The \npetitioners clustered near the tall doors, the knights and high lords and ladies beneath \nthe tapestries, the smallfolk in the gallery, the mailed guards in their cloaks, gold or \ngrey: all stood.\nThe villagers were kneeling: men, women, and children, alike tattered and bloody, their \nfaces drawn by fear.

Of \ncourse, Jeyne had been in love with Lord Beric ever since she had first glimpsed him in \nthe lists.

Only animals, though. Sansa was certain her prince had no part in murdering Jory \nand those other poor men; that had been his wicked uncle, the Kingslayer.

The stallion\u2019s \nblood looked black in the flickering orange glare of the torches that ringed the high chalk \nwalls of the pit.\nDany touched the soft swell of her belly. Sweat beaded her skin and trickled down her \nbrow. She could feel the old women watching her, the ancient crones of Vaes Dothrak, \nwith eyes that shone dark as polished flint in their wrinkled faces. She must not flinch or \nlook afraid. I am the blood of the dragon, she told herself as she took the stallion\u2019s heart \nin both hands, lifted it to her mouth, and plunged her teeth into the tough, stringy flesh.\nWarm blood filled her mouth and ran down over her chin. The taste threatened to gag \nher, but she made herself chew and swallow. The heart of a stallion would make her son \nstrong and swift and fearless, or so the Dothraki believed, but only if the mother could \neat it all. If she choked on the blood or retched up the flesh, the omens were less \nfavorable; the child might be stillborn, or come forth weak, deformed, or female.\nHer handmaids had helped her ready herself for the ceremony. Despite the tender \nmother\u2019s stomach that had afflicted her these past two moons, Dany had dined on bowls \nof half-clotted blood to accustom herself to the taste, and Irri made her chew strips of \ndried horseflesh until her jaws were aching. She had starved herself for a day and a night \nbefore the ceremony in the hopes that hunger would help her keep down the raw meat.\nThe wild stallion\u2019s heart was all muscle, and Dany had to worry it with her teeth and \nchew each mouthful a long time. No steel was permitted within the sacred confines of \nVaes Dothrak, beneath the shadow of the Mother of Mountains; she had to rip the heart \napart with teeth and nails. Her stomach roiled and heaved, yet she kept on, her face \nsmeared with the heartsblood that sometimes seemed to explode against her lips.\nKhal Drogo stood over her as she ate, his face as hard as a bronze shield. His long black \nbraid was shiny with oil. He wore gold rings in his mustache, gold bells in his braid, and \na heavy belt of solid gold medallions around his waist, but his chest was bare. She looked \nat him whenever she felt her strength failing; looked at him, and chewed and swallowed, \nchewed and swallowed, chewed and swallowed.

The crones of the dosh khaleen came first, with their eunuchs and \nslaves. Some supported themselves with tall carved staffs as they struggled along on \nancient, shaking legs, while others walked as proud as any horselord. Each of the old \nwomen had been a khaleesi once. When their lord husbands died and a new khal took \nhis place at the front of his riders, with a new khaleesi mounted beside him, they were \nsent here, to reign over the vast Dothraki nation. Even the mightiest of khals bowed to \nthe wisdom and authority of the dosh khaleen. Still, it gave Dany the shivers to think \nthat one day she might be sent to join them, whether she willed it or no.\nBehind the wise women came the others; Khal Ogo and his son, the khalakka Fogo, Khal \nJommo and his wives, the chief men of Drogo\u2019s khalasar, Dany\u2019s handmaids, the khal\u2019s \nservants and slaves, and more. Bells rang and drums beat a stately cadence as they \nmarched along the godsway. Stolen heroes and the gods of dead peoples brooded in the \ndarkness beyond the road. Alongside the procession, slaves ran lightly through the grass \nwith torches in their hands, and the flickering flames made the great monuments seem \nalmost alive.\n\u201cWhat is meaning, name Rhaego?\u201d Khal Drogo asked as they walked, using the Common \nTongue of the Seven Kingdoms.

Naked, she stepped gingerly into the water. Irri said the lake had no \nbottom, but Dany felt soft mud squishing between her toes as she pushed through the \ntall reeds. The moon floated on the still black waters, shattering and re-forming as her \nripples washed over it. Goose pimples rose on her pale skin as the coldness crept up her \nthighs and kissed her lower lips. The stallion\u2019s blood had dried on her hands and around \nher mouth. Dany cupped her fingers and lifted the sacred waters over her head, \ncleansing herself and the child inside her while the khal and the others looked on. She \nheard the old women of the dosh khaleen muttering to each other as they watched, and \nwondered what they were saying.\nWhen she emerged from the lake, shivering and dripping, her handmaid Doreah hurried \nto her with a robe of painted sandsilk, but Khal Drogo waved her away. He was looking \non her swollen breasts and the curve of her belly with approval, and Dany could see the \nshape of his manhood pressing through his horsehide trousers, below the heavy gold \nmedallions of his belt. She went to him and helped him unlace. Then her huge khal took \nher by the hips and lifted her into the air, as he might lift a child.

On her finger was a golden ring with an emerald the size of a pigeon\u2019s egg, \non her head a matching tiara.\nAbove them, Prince Joffrey sat amidst the barbs and spikes in a cloth-of-gold doublet \nand a red satin cape.

Syrio caught the thrust in the \nhelmet and shattered the man\u2019s kneecap with his stick. The last red cloak shouted a \ncurse and charged, hacking down with both hands on his sword. Syrio rolled right, and \nthe butcher\u2019s cut caught the helmetless man between neck and shoulder as he struggled \nto his knees. The longsword crunched through mail and leather and flesh. The man on \nhis knees shrieked. Before his killer could wrench free his blade, Syrio jabbed him in the \napple of his throat. The guardsman gave a choked cry and staggered back, clutching at \nhis neck, his face blackening.\nFive men were down, dead, or dying by the time Arya reached the back door that opened \non the kitchen. She heard Ser Meryn Trant curse. \u201cBloody oafs,\u201d he swore, drawing his \nlongsword from its scabbard.\nSyrio Forel resumed his stance and clicked his teeth together. \u201cArya child,\u201d he called out, \nnever looking at her, \u201cbe gone now.\u201d\nLook with your eyes, he had said. She saw: the knight in his pale armor head to foot, \nlegs, throat, and hands sheathed in metal, eyes hidden behind his high white helm, and \nin his hand cruel steel. Against that: Syrio, in a leather vest, with a wooden sword in his \nhand. \u201cSyrio, run,\u201d she screamed.\n\u201cThe first sword of Braavos does not run,\u201d he sang as Ser Meryn slashed at him. Syrio \ndanced away from his cut, his stick a blur. In a heartbeat, he had bounced blows off the \nknight\u2019s temple, elbow, and throat, the wood ringing against the metal of helm, gauntlet, \nand gorget. Arya stood frozen. Ser Meryn advanced; Syrio backed away. He checked the \nnext blow, spun away from the second, deflected the third.\nThe fourth sliced his stick in two, splintering the wood and shearing through the lead \ncore.\nSobbing, Arya spun and ran.\nShe plunged through the kitchens and buttery, blind with panic, weaving between cooks \nand potboys. A baker\u2019s helper stepped in front of her, holding a wooden tray. Arya \nbowled her over, scattering fragrant loaves of fresh-baked bread on the floor.

A wagon, laden with crates and chests, stood abandoned near the door \nof the stable. The dead men must have been loading it for the trip to the docks when they \nwere attacked. Arya snuck closer. One of the corpses was Desmond, who\u2019d shown her his \nlongsword and promised to protect her father. He lay on his back, staring blindly at the \nceiling as flies crawled across his eyes. Close to him was a dead man in the red cloak and \nlion-crest helm of the Lannisters. Only one, though. Every northerner is worth ten of \nthese southron swords, Desmond had told her. \u201cYou liar!\u201d she said, kicking his body in a \nsudden fury.\nThe animals were restless in their stalls, whickering and snorting at the scent of blood. \nArya\u2019s only plan was to saddle a horse and flee, away from the castle and the city.

A stableboy stood behind her, a smirk on his face, his filthy white \nundertunic peeking out from beneath a soiled jerkin.

By the time she reached the shadow of the royal sept on the far \nside of the yard, Arya was cold with sweat, but no one had raised the hue and cry.\nThe sept was open and empty. Inside, half a hundred prayer candles burned in a fragrant \nsilence. Arya figured the gods would never miss two. She stuffed them up her sleeves, \nand left by a back window. Sneaking back to the alley where she had cornered the one-\neared tom was easy, but after that she got lost.

That was chancy; \nthe fire she\u2019d remembered seeing had burnt down to embers, and she heard voices as \nshe was blowing on the coals. Cupping her fingers around the flickering candle, she went \nout the window as they were coming in the door, without ever getting a glimpse of who it \nwas.\nThis time the monsters did not frighten her. They seemed almost old friends. Arya held \nthe candle over her head. With each step she took, the shadows moved against the walls, \nas if they were turning to watch her pass. \u201cDragons,\u201d she whispered. She slid Needle out \nfrom under her cloak.

She held \nNeedle in her left hand, her sword hand, the candle in her right fist. Hot wax ran down \nacross her knuckles.

Maybe \nshe would be better off without the light . . . \nFear cuts deeper than swords, the quiet voice inside her whispered. Suddenly Arya \nremembered the crypts at Winterfell.

They\u2019d only had one candle between them, and Bran\u2019s eyes had gotten as big as \nsaucers as he stared at the stone faces of the Kings of Winter, with their wolves at their \nfeet and their iron swords across their laps.\nRobb took them all the way down to the end, past Grandfather and Brandon and \nLyanna, to show them their own tombs. Sansa kept looking at the stubby little candle, \nanxious that it might go out. Old Nan had told her there were spiders down here, and \nrats as big as dogs. Robb smiled when she said that. \u201cThere are worse things than \nspiders and rats,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThis is where the dead walk.\u201d That was when they \nheard the sound, low and deep and shivery. Baby Bran had clutched at Arya\u2019s hand.\nWhen the spirit stepped out of the open tomb, pale white and moaning for blood, Sansa \nran shrieking for the stairs, and Bran wrapped himself around Robb\u2019s leg, sobbing. Arya \nstood her ground and gave the spirit a punch. It was only Jon, covered with flour. \u201cYou \nstupid,\u201d she told him, \u201cyou scared the baby,\u201d but Jon and Robb just laughed and \nlaughed, and pretty soon Bran and Arya were laughing too.\nThe memory made Arya smile, and after that the darkness held no more terrors for her. \nThe stableboy was dead, she\u2019d killed him, and if he jumped out at her she\u2019d kill him \nagain.

In the songs, the knights never screamed nor \nbegged for mercy.\nSo she wept, pleading through her door for them to tell her what was happening, calling \nfor her father, for Septa Mordane, for the king, for her gallant prince. If the men \nguarding her heard her pleas, they gave no answer.

Ghost was with him, he knew that much. The \nsilent presence of the direwolf gave him comfort. The girls do not even have that much, \nhe thought.

Our lady \nmother would skin me for a pelt if I let you put yourself at risk.\u201d He was using the voice \nof Robb the Lord when he said it; Bran knew that meant there was no appeal.\nIt was because of what had happened in the wolfswood, he knew.

Luwin had gotten \nthe idea from the baskets the women used to carry firewood on their backs; after that it \nhad been a simple matter of cutting legholes and attaching some new straps to spread \nBran\u2019s weight more evenly.

They wore \nblack iron halfhelms and black woolen cloaks patterned with the white sunburst.

They walked down a long \ndim hallway, Summer padding easily beside them. The wolf glanced up from time to \ntime, eyes smoldering like liquid gold. Bran would have liked to touch him, but he was \nriding too high for his hand to reach.\nThe godswood was an island of peace in the sea of chaos that Winterfell had become. \nHodor made his way through the dense stands of oak and ironwood and sentinels, to the \nstill pool beside the heart tree. He stopped under the gnarled limbs of the weirwood, \nhumming.

He rubbed the wolf under \nthe jaw, and for a moment boy and beast both felt at peace. Bran had always liked the \ngodswood, even before, but of late he found himself drawn to it more and more. Even \nthe heart tree no longer scared him the way it used to. The deep red eyes carved into the \npale trunk still watched him, yet somehow he took comfort from that now.

None had ever returned. And Father \nhad gone south, with Arya and Sansa, and Jory and Hullen and Fat Tom and the rest, \nand later Mother and Ser Rodrik had gone, and they hadn\u2019t come back either.

Bran heard muffled footfalls and a low humming, and Hodor \ncame blundering out of the trees, naked and smiling. \u201cHodor!\u201d\n\u201cHe must have heard our voices,\u201d Bran said. \u201cHodor, you forgot your clothes.\u201d\n\u201cHodor,\u201d Hodor agreed. He was dripping wet from the neck down, steaming in the chill \nair. His body was covered with brown hair, thick as a pelt. Between his legs, his \nmanhood swung long and heavy.\nOsha eyed him with a sour smile. \u201cNow there\u2019s a big man,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has giant\u2019s \nblood in him, or I\u2019m the queen.\u201d\n\u201cMaester Luwin says there are no more giants. He says they\u2019re all dead, like the children \nof the forest. All that\u2019s left of them are old bones in the earth that men turn up with \nplows from time to time.\u201d\n\u201cLet Maester Luwin ride beyond the Wall,\u201d Osha said. \u201cHe\u2019ll find giants then, or they\u2019ll \nfind him. My brother killed one. Ten foot tall she was, and stunted at that. They\u2019ve been \nknown to grow big as twelve and thirteen feet. Fierce things they are too, all hair and \nteeth, and the wives have beards like their husbands, so there\u2019s no telling them apart. \nThe women take human men for lovers, and it\u2019s from them the half bloods come. It goes \nharder on the women they catch. The men are so big they\u2019ll rip a maid apart before they \nget her with child.\u201d She grinned at him. \u201cBut you don\u2019t know what I mean, do you, boy?\u201d\n\u201cYes I do,\u201d Bran insisted. He understood about mating; he had seen dogs in the yard, \nand watched a stallion mount a mare. But talking about it made him uncomfortable. He \nlooked at Hodor. \u201cGo back and bring your clothes, Hodor,\u201d he said. \u201cGo dress.\u201d\n\u201cHodor.\u201d He walked back the way he had come, ducking under a low-hanging tree limb.\nHe was awfully big, Bran thought as he watched him go. \u201cAre there truly giants beyond \nthe Wall?\u201d he asked Osha, uncertainly.\n\u201cGiants and worse than giants, Lordling. I tried to tell your brother when he asked his \nquestions, him and your maester and that smiley boy Greyjoy. The cold winds are rising, \nand men go out from their fires and never come back . . . or if they do, they\u2019re not men \nno more, but only wights, with blue eyes and cold black hands.

They were led to a spot of high ground \ndry enough for a camp. Ser Wylis called a halt there, and remained behind with his men \nto see the fires laid and the horses tended, while his brother Wendel rode on with \nCatelyn and her uncle to present their father\u2019s respects to their liege lord.\nThe ground under their horses\u2019 hooves was soft and wet. It fell away slowly beneath \nthem as they rode past smoky peat fires, lines of horses, and wagons heavy-laden with \nhardbread and salt beef. On a stony outcrop of land higher than the surrounding \ncountry, they passed a lord\u2019s pavilion with walls of heavy sailcloth. Catelyn recognized \nthe banner, the bull moose of the Hornwoods, brown on its dark orange field.\nJust beyond, through the mists, she glimpsed the walls and towers of Moat Cailin . . . or \nwhat remained of them. Immense blocks of black basalt, each as large as a crofter\u2019s \ncottage, lay scattered and tumbled like a child\u2019s wooden blocks, half-sunk in the soft \nboggy soil. Nothing else remained of a curtain wall that had once stood as high as \nWinterfell\u2019s. The wooden keep was gone entirely, rotted away a thousand years past, \nwith not so much as a timber to mark where it had stood. All that was left of the great \nstronghold of the First Men were three towers . . . three where there had once been \ntwenty, if the taletellers could be believed.\nThe Gatehouse Tower looked sound enough, and even boasted a few feet of standing wall \nto either side of it. The Drunkard\u2019s Tower, off in the bog where the south and west walls \nhad once met, leaned like a man about to spew a bellyful of wine into the gutter. And the \ntall, slender Children\u2019s Tower, where legend said the children of the forest had once \ncalled upon their nameless gods to send the hammer of the waters, had lost half its \ncrown. It looked as if some great beast had taken a bite out of the crenellations along the \ntower top, and spit the rubble across the bog. All three towers were green with moss. A \ntree was growing out between the stones on the north side of the Gatehouse Tower, its \ngnarled limbs festooned with ropy white blankets of ghostskin.\n\u201cGods have mercy,\u201d Ser Brynden exclaimed when he saw what lay before them. \u201cThis is \nMoat Cailin? It\u2019s no more than a\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014death trap,\u201d Catelyn finished. \u201cI know how it looks, Uncle.

His eyes were a pale green, flecked with gold. A fool more foolish than \nmost had once jested that even Lord Tywin\u2019s shit was flecked with gold.

Warm days and cool \nnights and the sweet taste of wine. He remembered Brandon\u2019s laughter, and Robert\u2019s \nberserk valor in the melee, the way he laughed as he unhorsed men left and right. He \nremembered Jaime Lannister, a golden youth in scaled white armor, kneeling on the \ngrass in front of the king\u2019s pavilion and making his vows to protect and defend King \nAerys. Afterward, Ser Oswell Whent helped Jaime to his feet, and the White Bull \nhimself, Lord Commander Ser Gerold Hightower, fastened the snowy cloak of the \nKingsguard about his shoulders. All six White Swords were there to welcome their \nnewest brother.\nYet when the jousting began, the day belonged to Rhaegar Targaryen. The crown prince \nwore the armor he would die in: gleaming black plate with the three-headed dragon of \nhis House wrought in rubies on the breast. A plume of scarlet silk streamed behind him \nwhen he rode, and it seemed no lance could touch him. Brandon fell to him, and Bronze \nYohn Royce, and even the splendid Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning.\nRobert had been jesting with Jon and old Lord Hunter as the prince circled the field \nafter unhorsing Ser Barristan in the final tilt to claim the champion\u2019s crown.

He could see it still: a crown of winter roses, blue as frost.\nNed Stark reached out his hand to grasp the flowery crown, but beneath the pale blue \npetals the thorns lay hidden. He felt them clawing at his skin, sharp and cruel, saw the \nslow trickle of blood run down his fingers, and woke, trembling, in the dark.\nPromise me, Ned, his sister had whispered from her bed of blood.

Carefully he pulled it from its scabbard and raised it level with his eyes.\nThe pommel was a hunk of pale stone weighted with lead to balance the long blade. It \nhad been carved into the likeness of a snarling wolf\u2019s head, with chips of garnet set into \nthe eyes. The grip was virgin leather, soft and black, as yet unstained by sweat or blood. \nThe blade itself was a good half foot longer than those Jon was used to, tapered to thrust \nas well as slash, with three fullers deeply incised in the metal. Where Ice was a true two-\nhanded greatsword, this was a hand-and-a-halfer, sometimes named a \u201cbastard sword.\u201d \nYet the wolf sword actually seemed lighter than the blades he had wielded before. When \nJon turned it sideways, he could see the ripples in the dark steel where the metal had \nbeen folded back on itself again and again. \u201cThis is Valyrian steel, my lord,\u201d he said \nwonderingly.

Dying \nhorses lifted their heads and screamed at her as she rode past. Wounded men moaned \nand prayed. Jaqqa rhan moved among them, the mercy men with their heavy axes, \ntaking a harvest of heads from the dead and dying alike. After them would scurry a flock \nof small girls, pulling arrows from the corpses to fill their baskets. Last of all the dogs \nwould come sniffing, lean and hungry, the feral pack that was never far behind the \nkhalasar.\nThe sheep had been dead longest. There seemed to be thousands of them, black with \nflies, arrow shafts bristling from each carcass. Khal Ogo\u2019s riders had done that, Dany \nknew; no man of Drogo\u2019s khalasar would be such a fool as to waste his arrows on sheep \nwhen there were shepherds yet to kill.\nThe town was afire, black plumes of smoke roiling and tumbling as they rose into a hard \nblue sky. Beneath broken walls of dried mud, riders galloped back and forth, swinging \ntheir long whips as they herded the survivors from the smoking rubble. The women and \nchildren of Ogo\u2019s khalasar walked with a sullen pride, even in defeat and bondage; they \nwere slaves now, but they seemed not to fear it. It was different with the townsfolk. Dany \npitied them; she remembered what terror felt like. Mothers stumbled along with blank, \ndead faces, pulling sobbing children by the hand. There were only a few men among \nthem, cripples and cowards and grandfathers.\nSer Jorah said the people of this country named themselves the Lhazareen, but the \nDothraki called them haesh rakhi, the Lamb Men. Once Dany might have taken them for \nDothraki, for they had the same copper skin and almond-shaped eyes. Now they looked \nalien to her, squat and flat-faced, their black hair cropped unnaturally short. They were \nherders of sheep and eaters of vegetables, and Khal Drogo said they belonged south of \nthe river bend. The grass of the Dothraki sea was not meant for sheep.\nDany saw one boy bolt and run for the river.

What grass the horses had left was heavy with dew, as if some \npassing god had scattered a bag of diamonds over the earth. The mountain men fell in \nbehind him, each clan arrayed behind its own leaders.\nIn the dawn light, the army of Lord Tywin Lannister unfolded like an iron rose, thorns \ngleaming.\nHis uncle would lead the center. Ser Kevan had raised his standards above the \nkingsroad. Quivers hanging from their belts, the foot archers arrayed themselves into \nthree long lines, to east and west of the road, and stood calmly stringing their bows. \nBetween them, pikemen formed squares; behind were rank on rank of men-at-arms with \nspear and sword and axe. Three hundred heavy horse surrounded Ser Kevan and the \nlords bannermen Lefford, Lydden, and Serrett with all their sworn retainers.\nThe right wing was all cavalry, some four thousand men, heavy with the weight of their \narmor. More than three quarters of the knights were there, massed together like a great \nsteel fist. Ser Addam Marbrand had the command. Tyrion saw his banner unfurl as his \nstandardbearer shook it out; a burning tree, orange and smoke. Behind him flew Ser \nFlement\u2019s purple unicorn, the brindled boar of Crakehall, the bantam rooster of Swyft, \nand more.\nHis lord father took his place on the hill where he had slept. Around him, the reserve \nassembled; a huge force, half mounted and half foot, five thousand strong. Lord Tywin \nalmost always chose to command the reserve; he would take the high ground and watch \nthe battle unfold below him, committing his forces when and where they were needed \nmost.\nEven from afar, his lord father was resplendent.

His greatcloak was sewn from countless layers of cloth-\nof-gold, so heavy that it barely stirred even when he charged, so large that its drape \ncovered most of his stallion\u2019s hindquarters when he took the saddle.

The ground was rolling and \nuneven here; soft and muddy near the river, rising in a gentle slope toward the \nkingsroad, stony and broken beyond it, to the cast. A few trees spotted the hillsides, but \nmost of the land had been cleared and planted. His heart pounded in his chest in time to \nthe drums, and under his layers of leather and steel his brow was cold with sweat. He \nwatched Ser Gregor as the Mountain rode up and down the line, shouting and \ngesticulating. This wing too was all cavalry, but where the right was a mailed fist of \nknights and heavy lancers, the vanguard was made up of the sweepings of the west: \nmounted archers in leather jerkins, a swarming mass of undisciplined freeriders and \nsellswords, fieldhands on plow horses armed with scythes and their fathers\u2019 rusted \nswords, half-trained boys from the stews of Lannisport . . . and Tyrion and his mountain \nclansmen.\n\u201cCrow food,\u201d Bronn muttered beside him, giving voice to what Tyrion had left unsaid. He \ncould only nod. Had his lord father taken leave of his senses? No pikes, too few bowmen, \na bare handful of knights, the ill-armed and unarmored, commanded by an unthinking \nbrute who led with his rage . . . how could his father expect this travesty of a battle to \nhold his left?\nHe had no time to think about it. The drums were so near that the beat crept under his \nskin and set his hands to twitching. Bronn drew his longsword, and suddenly the enemy \nwas there before them, boiling over the tops of the hills, advancing with measured tread \nbehind a wall of shields and pikes.\nGods be damned, look at them all, Tyrion thought, though he knew his father had more \nmen on the field. Their captains led them on armored warhorses, standard-bearers \nriding alongside with their banners. He glimpsed the bull moose of the Hornwoods, the \nKarstark sunburst, Lord Cerwyn\u2019s battle-axe, and the mailed fist of the Glovers . . . and \nthe twin towers of Frey, blue on grey. So much for his father\u2019s certainty that Lord Walder \nwould not bestir himself.

Gregor \nClegane was the first to reach them, leading a wedge of armored veterans. Half the \nhorses shied at the last second, breaking their charge before the row of spears. The \nothers died, sharp steel points ripping through their chests. Tyrion saw a dozen men go \ndown. The Mountain\u2019s stallion reared, lashing out with iron-shod hooves as a barbed \nspearhead raked across his neck. Maddened, the beast lunged into the ranks. Spears \nthrust at him from every side, but the shield wall broke beneath his weight. The \nnortherners stumbled away from the animal\u2019s death throes.

Chella daughter of Cheyk rode up as they were \nyanking arrows out of Shagga, and showed them four ears she had taken. Timett they \ndiscovered looting the bodies of the slain with his Burned Men.

He was short, with a little round \nbelly, and when he moved he seemed to favor his left leg a little.

Two of the City Watch were standing at the mouth of an \nalley. Their cloaks hung almost to the ground, the heavy wool dyed a rich gold; their mail \nand boots and gloves were black. One wore a longsword at his hip, the other an iron \ncudgel. With a last wistful glance at the tarts, Arya edged back from the cart and hurried \noff. The gold cloaks had not been paying her any special attention, but the sight of them \ntied her stomach in knots. Arya had been staying as far from the castle as she could get, \nyet even from a distance she could see the heads rotting atop the high red walls. Flocks \nof crows squabbled noisily over each head, thick as flies. The talk in Flea Bottom was \nthat the gold cloaks had thrown in with the Lannisters, their commander raised to a \nlord, with lands on the Trident and a seat on the king\u2019s council.\nShe had also heard other things, scary things, things that made no sense to her. Some \nsaid her father had murdered King Robert and been slain in turn by Lord Renly. Others \ninsisted that Renly had killed the king in a drunken quarrel between brothers. Why else \nshould he have fled in the night like a common thief? One story said the king had been \nkilled by a boar while hunting, another that he\u2019d died eating a boar, stuffing himself so \nfull that he\u2019d ruptured at the table. No, the king had died at table, others said, but only \nbecause Varys the Spider poisoned him. No, it had been the queen who poisoned him. \nNo, he had died of a pox. No, he had choked on a fish bone.\nOne thing all the stories agreed on: King Robert was dead. The bells in the seven towers \nof the Great Sept of Baelor had tolled for a day and a night, the thunder of their grief \nrolling across the city in a bronze tide. They only rang the bells like that for the death of \na king, a tanner\u2019s boy told Arya.\nAll she wanted was to go home, but leaving King\u2019s Landing was not so easy as she had \nhoped. Talk of war was on every lip, and gold cloaks were as thick on the city walls as \nfleas on . . . well, her, for one. She had been sleeping in Flea Bottom, on rooftops and in \nstables, wherever she could find a place to lie down, and it hadn\u2019t taken her long to learn \nthat the district was well named.\nEvery day since her escape from the Red Keep, Arya had visited each of the seven city \ngates in turn. The Dragon Gate, the Lion Gate, and the Old Gate were closed and barred. \nThe Mud Gate and the Gate of the Gods were open, but only to those who wanted to \nenter the city; the guards let no one out. Those who were allowed to leave left by the \nKing\u2019s Gate or the Iron Gate, but Lannister men-at-arms in crimson cloaks and lion-\ncrested helms manned the guard posts there. Spying down from the roof of an inn by the \nKing\u2019s Gate, Arya saw them searching wagons and carriages, forcing riders to open their \nsaddlebags, and questioning everyone who tried to pass on foot.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2956, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d685824-43e4-4377-b52a-86af9b52cfe6": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d685824-43e4-4377-b52a-86af9b52cfe6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "654", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e4c12cc-e6b3-4d1f-9368-17d7f87e9df6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "654", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "hash": "3caf5ba15d9d8faa241c4d265c1e502687bba4ff2aa51242064607ae23d3047d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Sometimes she thought about swimming the river, but the Blackwater Rush was wide \nand deep, and everyone agreed that its currents were wicked and treacherous.

A couple times, she was followed out into the alleys and chased, but so far no one \nhad been able to catch her.\nThe silver bracelet she\u2019d hoped to sell had been stolen her first night out of the castle, \nalong with her bundle of good clothes, snatched while she slept in a burnt-out house off \nPig Alley. All they left her was the cloak she had been huddled in, the leathers on her \nback, her wooden practice sword . . . and Needle. She\u2019d been lying on top of Needle, or \nelse it would have been gone too; it was worth more than all the rest together. Since then \nArya had taken to walking around with her cloak draped over her right arm, to conceal \nthe blade at her hip. The wooden sword she carried in her left hand, out where \neverybody could see it, to scare off robbers, but there were men in the pot-shops who \nwouldn\u2019t have been scared off if she\u2019d had a battle-axe.

Only yesterday, a scrawny barefoot girl twice her age had \nknocked her down and tried to pull the boots off her feet, but Arya gave her a crack on \nher ear with her stick sword that sent her off sobbing and bleeding.\nA gull wheeled overhead as she made her way down the hill toward Flea Bottom. Arya \nglanced at it thoughtfully, but it was well beyond the reach of her stick. It made her think \nof the sea. Maybe that was the way out. Old Nan used to tell stories of boys who stowed \naway on trading galleys and sailed off into all kinds of adventures. Maybe Arya could do \nthat too. She decided to visit the riverfront. It was on the way to the Mud Gate anyway, \nand she hadn\u2019t checked that one today.\nThe wharfs were oddly quiet when Arya got there. She spied another pair of gold cloaks, \nwalking side by side through the fish market, but they never so much as looked at her. \nHalf the stalls were empty, and it seemed to her that there were fewer ships at dock than \nshe remembered. Out on the Blackwater, three of the king\u2019s war galleys moved in \nformation, gold-painted hulls splitting the water as their oars rose and fell. Arya watched \nthem for a bit, then began to make her way along the river.\nWhen she saw the guardsmen on the third pier, in grey woolen cloaks trimmed with \nwhite satin, her heart almost stopped in her chest. The sight of Winterfell\u2019s colors \nbrought tears to her eyes. Behind them, a sleek three-banked trading galley rocked at her", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2934, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56517de3-c9e2-4dd6-bff2-a92d96b6669b": {"__data__": {"id_": "56517de3-c9e2-4dd6-bff2-a92d96b6669b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "656", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce882809-7bf0-454a-8fe8-11a3d98f9121", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "656", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "hash": "198a7046f63e7a52dfa71fd8d25ecb319885c41009734e2ca99070b60ecb42f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "moorings.

There were no men at all. Only the children of \nthe forest dwelt in the lands we now call the Seven Kingdoms.\n\u201cThey were a people dark and beautiful, small of stature, no taller than children even \nwhen grown to manhood. They lived in the depths of the wood, in caves and crannogs \nand secret tree towns. Slight as they were, the children were quick and graceful. Male \nand female hunted together, with weirwood bows and flying snares. Their gods were the \ngods of the forest, stream, and stone, the old gods whose names are secret. Their wise \nmen were called greenseers, and carved strange faces in the weirwoods to keep watch on \nthe woods. How long the children reigned here or where they came from, no man can \nknow.\n\u201cBut some twelve thousand years ago, the First Men appeared from the east, crossing the \nBroken Arm of Dorne before it was broken. They came with bronze swords and great \nleathern shields, riding horses. No horse had ever been seen on this side of the narrow \nsea. No doubt the children were as frightened by the horses as the First Men were by the \nfaces in the trees.

When he left he gave her a potion of honeywater and herbs and \ntold her to drink a swallow every night. She drank it all right then and went back to sleep.\nShe dreamt of footsteps on the tower stair, an ominous scraping of leather on stone as a \nman climbed slowly toward her bedchamber, step by step.

She had \nnot washed since the day her father died, and she was startled at how filthy the water \nbecame. Her maids sluiced the blood off her face, scrubbed the dirt from her back, \nwashed her hair and brushed it out until it sprang back in thick auburn curls. Sansa did \nnot speak to them, except to give them commands; they were Lannister servants, not her \nown, and she did not trust them. When the time came to dress, she chose the green silk \ngown that she had worn to the tourney. She recalled how gallant Joff had been to her \nthat night at the feast. Perhaps it would make him remember as well, and treat her more \ngently.\nShe drank a glass of buttermilk and nibbled at some sweet biscuits as she waited, to \nsettle her stomach. It was midday when Ser Meryn returned. He had donned his white \narmor; a shirt of enameled scales chased with gold, a tall helm with a golden sunburst \ncrest, greaves and gorget and gauntlet and boots of gleaming plate, a heavy wool cloak \nclasped with a golden lion.

Nine cases out of ten seemed to bore him; those he allowed \nhis council to handle, squirming restlessly while Lord Baelish, Grand Maester Pycelle, or \nQueen Cersei resolved the matter. When he did choose to make a ruling, though, not \neven his queen mother could sway him.\nA thief was brought before him and he had Ser Ilyn chop his hand off, right there in \ncourt. Two knights came to him with a dispute about some land, and he decreed that \nthey should duel for it on the morrow. \u201cTo the death,\u201d he added. A woman fell to her \nknees to plead for the head of a man executed as a traitor. She had loved him, she said, \nand she wanted to see him decently buried. \u201cIf you loved a traitor, you must be a traitor \ntoo,\u201d Joffrey said. Two gold cloaks dragged her off to the dungeons.\nFrog-faced Lord Slynt sat at the end of the council table wearing a black velvet doublet \nand a shiny cloth-of-gold cape, nodding with approval every time the king pronounced a \nsentence. Sansa stared hard at his ugly face, remembering how he had thrown down her \nfather for Ser Ilyn to behead, wishing she could hurt him, wishing that some hero would \nthrow him down and cut off his head. But a voice inside her whispered, There are no \nheroes, and she remembered what Lord Petyr had said to her, here in this very hall. \u201cLife \nis not a song, sweetling,\u201d he\u2019d told her. \u201cYou may learn that one day to your sorrow.\u201d In \nlife, the monsters win, she told herself, and now it was the Hound\u2019s voice she heard, a \ncold rasp, metal on stone. \u201cSave yourself some pain, girl, and give him what he wants.\u201d\nThe last case was a plump tavern singer, accused of making a song that ridiculed the late \nKing Robert. Joff commanded them to fetch his woodharp and ordered him to perform \nthe song for the court. The singer wept and swore he would never sing that song again, \nbut the king insisted. It was sort of a funny song, all about Robert fighting with a pig. \nThe pig was the boar who\u2019d killed him, Sansa knew, but in some verses it almost \nsounded as if he were singing about the queen. When the song was done, Joffrey \nannounced that he\u2019d decided to be merciful. The singer could keep either his fingers or \nhis tongue. He would have a day to make his choice. Janos Slynt nodded.\nThat was the final business of the afternoon, Sansa saw with relief, but her ordeal was \nnot yet done. When the herald\u2019s voice dismissed the court, she fled the balcony, only to \nfind Joffrey waiting for her at the base of the curving stairs. The Hound was with him, \nand Ser Meryn as well. The young king examined her critically, top to bottom. \u201cYou look \nmuch better than you did.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Your Grace,\u201d Sansa said.

At \nthe other end of the Street of the Sisters stood the fire-blackened ruins of the Dragonpit. \nTo the west, the swollen red sun was half-hidden behind the Gate of the Gods.

She had wept in her dream, \nand the tears had turned to steam on her cheeks. All the grief has been burned out of \nme, she told herself. She felt sad, and yet . . . she could feel Rhaego receding from her, as \nif he had never been.\nSer Jorah and Mirri Maz Duur entered a few moments later, and found Dany standing \nover the other dragon\u2019s eggs, the two still in their chest. It seemed to her that they felt as \nhot as the one she had slept with, which was passing strange. \u201cSer Jorah, come here,\u201d \nshe said.

She clutched it to \nher breasts as she walked back out to Drogo, to her sun-and-stars. If I look back I am \nlost. It hurt even to walk, and she wanted to sleep, to sleep and not to dream.\nShe knelt, kissed Drogo on the lips, and pressed the cushion down across his face.\n \nprevious | Table of Contents | next", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2497, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a36978ba-6550-409a-a1fa-29ab9d76bb34": {"__data__": {"id_": "a36978ba-6550-409a-a1fa-29ab9d76bb34", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "692", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4c09ac20-b16e-426a-80a7-bf7ef1a1499c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "692", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "hash": "5eb54476f1f8e2e39a3afa6664cf47289b412226ada053f56df2ce207f68fc75", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "previous | Table of Contents | next\nTYRION\nThey have my son,\u201d Tywin Lannister said.\n\u201cThey do, my lord.\u201d The messenger\u2019s voice was dulled by exhaustion.

If questioned, \nSam would doubtless tell them the truth, but Jon could not imagine him braving the \nguards in front of the King\u2019s Tower to wake Mormont from sleep.\nWhen Jon did not appear to fetch the Old Bear\u2019s breakfast from the kitchen, they\u2019d look \nin his cell and find Longclaw on the bed. It had been hard to abandon it, but Jon was not \nso lost to honor as to take it with him. Even Jorah Mormont had not done that, when he \nfled in disgrace. Doubtless Lord Mormont would find someone more worthy of the \nblade. Jon felt bad when he thought of the old man. He knew his desertion would be salt \nin the still-raw wound of his son\u2019s disgrace. That seemed a poor way to repay him for his \ntrust, but it couldn\u2019t be helped. No matter what he did, Jon felt as though he were \nbetraying someone.\nEven now, he did not know if he was doing the honorable thing. The southron had it \neasier. They had their septons to talk to, someone to tell them the gods\u2019 will and help \nsort out right from wrong. But the Starks worshiped the old gods, the nameless gods, \nand if the heart trees heard, they did not speak.\nWhen the last lights of Castle Black vanished behind him, Jon slowed his mare to a walk. \nHe had a long journey ahead and only the one horse to see him through. There were \nholdfasts and farming villages along the road south where he might be able to trade the \nmare for a fresh mount when he needed one, but not if she were injured or blown.\nHe would need to find new clothes soon; most like, he\u2019d need to steal them. He was clad \nin black from head to heel; high leather riding boots, roughspun breeches and tunic, \nsleeveless leather jerkin, and heavy wool cloak. His longsword and dagger were sheathed \nin black moleskin, and the hauberk and coif in his saddlebag were black ringmail. Any \nbit of it could mean his death if he were taken. A stranger wearing black was viewed with \ncold suspicion in every village and holdfast north of the Neck, and men would soon be \nwatching for him. Once Maester Aemon\u2019s ravens took flight, Jon knew he would find no \nsafe haven. Not even at Winterfell. Bran might want to let him in, but Maester Luwin \nhad better sense. He would bar the gates and send Jon away, as he should. Better not to \ncall there at all.\nYet he saw the castle clear in his mind\u2019s eye, as if he had left it only yesterday; the", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2923, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b66a173-7226-4a9a-a0ea-cf749274ce8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b66a173-7226-4a9a-a0ea-cf749274ce8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "703", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e6fdb6a-0979-45a2-a098-a7b10586f00e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "703", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "hash": "7c31b305fb7cf64939395770b0e353423724191c8df8880b29e71ae7f63e301f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "towering granite walls, the Great Hall with its smells of smoke and dog and roasting \nmeat, his father\u2019s solar, the turret room where he had slept.

The wolf \nslowed, stopped, watching, his eyes glowing red in the moonlight. He vanished behind, \nbut Jon knew he would follow, at his own pace.\nScattered lights flickered through the trees ahead of him, on both sides of the road: \nMole\u2019s Town. A dog barked as he rode through, and he heard a mule\u2019s raucous haw from \nthe stable, but otherwise the village was still. Here and there the glow of hearth fires \nshone through shuttered windows, leaking between wooden slats, but only a few.\nMole\u2019s Town was bigger than it seemed, but three quarters of it was under the ground, in \ndeep warm cellars connected by a maze of tunnels. Even the whorehouse was down \nthere, nothing on the surface but a wooden shack no bigger than a privy, with a red \nlantern hung over the door.

That was oathbreaking too, yet no one seemed to care.\nNot until he was well beyond the village did Jon slow again. By then both he and the \nmare were damp with sweat. He dismounted, shivering, his burned hand aching. A bank \nof melting snow lay under the trees, bright in the moonlight, water trickling off to form \nsmall shallow pools. Jon squatted and brought his hands together, cupping the runoff \nbetween his fingers. The snowmelt was icy cold. He drank, and splashed some on his \nface, until his cheeks tingled. His fingers were throbbing worse than they had in days, \nand his head was pounding too. I am doing the right thing, he told himself, so why do I \nfeel so bad?\nThe horse was well lathered, so Jon took the lead and walked her for a while. The road \nwas scarcely wide enough for two riders to pass abreast, its surface cut by tiny streams \nand littered with stone. That run had been truly stupid, an invitation to a broken neck. \nJon wondered what had gotten into him. Was he in such a great rush to die?\nOff in the trees, the distant scream of some frightened animal made him look up. His \nmare whinnied nervously. Had his wolf found some prey?

And it was across the Tumblestone that they came home now, though the boy \nwore plate and mail in place of swaddling clothes.\nRobb sat in the bow with Grey Wind, his hand resting on his direwolf s head as the \nrowers pulled at their oars. Theon Greyjoy was with him. Her uncle Brynden would \ncome behind in the second boat, with the Greatjon and Lord Karstark.\nCatelyn took a place toward the stern. They shot down the Tumblestone, letting the \nstrong current push them past the looming Wheel Tower.

From the sandstone walls of the castle, soldiers and servants shouted \ndown her name, and Robb\u2019s, and \u201cWinterfell!\u201d From every rampart waved the banner of \nHouse Tully: a leaping trout, silver, against a rippling blue-and-red field.

The wide arch of the Water Gate came into view, and she \nheard the creak of heavy chains as the great iron portcullis was winched upward. It rose \nslowly as they approached, and Catelyn saw that the lower half of it was red with rust. \nThe bottom foot dripped brown mud on them as they passed underneath, the barbed \nspikes mere inches above their heads. Catelyn gazed up at the bars and wondered how \ndeep the rust went and how well the portcullis would stand up to a ram and whether it \nought to be replaced. Thoughts like that were seldom far from her mind these days.\nThey passed beneath the arch and under the walls, moving from sunlight to shadow and \nback into sunlight. Boats large and small were tied up all around them, secured to iron \nrings set in the stone. Her father\u2019s guards waited on the water stair with her brother. Ser \nEdmure Tully was a stocky young man with a shaggy head of auburn hair and a fiery \nbeard. His breastplate was scratched and dented from battle, his blue-and-red cloak \nstained by blood and smoke.

He had left two sons dead in the Whispering Wood, \nand there was no word of the third, his eldest, who had led the Karstark spears against \nTywin Lannister on the Green Fork.\nThe arguing raged on late into the night.

The wood crackled, louder and louder. \nMirri Maz Duur began to sing in a shrill, ululating voice. The flames whirled and \nwrithed, racing each other up the platform. The dusk shimmered as the air itself seemed \nto liquefy from the heat. Dany heard logs spit and crack. The fires swept over Mirri Maz \nDuur. Her song grew louder, shriller . . . then she gasped, again and again, and her song \nbecame a shuddering wail, thin and high and full of agony.\nAnd now the flames reached her Drogo, and now they were all around him.

The pyre roared in the deepening dusk like some great beast, drowning out the \nfainter sound of Mirri Maz Duur\u2019s screaming and sending up long tongues of flame to \nlick at the belly of the night. As the smoke grew thicker, the Dothraki backed away, \ncoughing. Huge orange gouts of fire unfurled their banners in that hellish wind, the logs \nhissing and cracking, glowing cinders rising on the smoke to float away into the dark like \nso many newborn fireflies. The heat beat at the air with great red wings, driving the \nDothraki back, driving off even Mormont, but Dany stood her ground. She was the blood \nof the dragon, and the fire was in her.\nShe had sensed the truth of it long ago, Dany thought as she took a step closer to the \nconflagration, but the brazier had not been hot enough. The flames writhed before her \nlike the women who had danced at her wedding, whirling and singing and spinning their \nyellow and orange and crimson veils, fearsome to behold, yet lovely, so lovely, alive with \nheat. Dany opened her arms to them, her skin flushed and glowing. This is a wedding, \ntoo, she thought. Mirri Maz Duur had fallen silent.

King of the Age of \nHeroes. Legend says the Grey King ruled not only the western isles but the \nsea itself, and took a mermaid to wife.\nFor thousands of years, raiders from the Iron Islands\u2014called \u201cironmen\u201d by \nthose they plundered\u2014were the terrors of the seas, sailing as far as the Port \nof Ibben and the Summer Isles. They prided themselves on their fierceness \nin battle and their sacred freedoms. Each island had its own \u201csalt king\u201d and \n\u201crock king.\u201d The High King of the Isles was chosen from among their \nnumber, until King Urron made the throne hereditary by murdering the other \nkings when they assembled for a choosing. Urron\u2019s own line was \nextinguished a thousand years later when the Andals swept over the islands. \nThe Greyjoys, like other island lords, intermarried with the conquerors.\nThe Iron Kings extended their rule far beyond the isles themselves, carving \nkingdoms out of the mainland with fire and sword. King Qhored could \ntruthfully boast that his writ ran \u201cwherever men can smell salt water or hear \nthe crash of waves.\u201d In later centuries, Qhored\u2019s descendants lost the Arbor, \nOldtown, Bear Island, and much of the western shore. Still, come the Wars \nof Conquest, King Harren the Black ruled all the lands between the \nmountains, from the Neck to the Blackwater Rush. When Harren and his \nsons perished in the fall of Harrenhal, Aegon Targaryen granted the \nriverlands to House Tully, and allowed the surviving lords of the Iron Islands \nto revive their ancient custom and choose who should have the primacy \namong them. They chose Lord Vickon Greyjoy of Pyke.\nThe Greyjoy sigil is a golden kraken upon a black field. Their words are We \nDo Not Sow.\nBALON GREYJOY, Lord of the Iron Islands, King of Salt and Rock, Son of \nthe Sea Wind, Lord Reaper of Pyke.\n\u2014his wife, LADY ALANNYS, of House Harlaw,\n\u2014their children:", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1944, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b80ead18-bb8f-4777-a469-4ec22b76d1d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "b80ead18-bb8f-4777-a469-4ec22b76d1d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "749", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "81fb5b02-0477-444b-b2c1-cd9297576db2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "749", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "hash": "87f255dfbf0fc3034c95c09c842f415ef6b1a74cd1f68786e34803c1e125118f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "\u2014{RODRIK}, their eldest son, slain at Seagard during Greyjoy\u2019s \nRebellion,\n\u2014{MARON}, their second son, slain on the walls of Pyke during \nGreyjoy\u2019s Rebellion,\n\u2014ASHA, their daughter, captain of the Black Wind,\n\u2014THEON, their sole surviving son, heir to Pyke, a ward of Lord \nEddard Stark,\n\u2014his brothers:\n\u2014EURON, called Crow\u2019s Eye, captain of the Silence, an outlaw, \npirate, and raider,\n\u2014VICTARION, Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet,\n\u2014AERON, called Damphair, a priest of the Drowned God,\n \nLesser houses sworn to Pyke include Harlaw, Stonehouse, Merlyn, Sunderly, \nBotley, Tawney, Wynch, Goodbrother.  \nprevious | Table of Contents | next", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 633, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1e0c99b-aef2-4df5-bb15-d65758fa0f1a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1e0c99b-aef2-4df5-bb15-d65758fa0f1a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "750", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6345660f-272f-430e-a5c5-69f40753982a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "750", "file_name": "e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\Generative AI Preparation\\Gen Ai Project\\QA_System\\Data\\e72f9f1f181a66887baa7270037c582e.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4921287, "creation_date": "2024-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-03"}, "hash": "707887cbac88ffc866f2e8e85b2c0e8b99559a1fca66c358485f8b2e8ecf632a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "previous | Table of Contents | next\nHOUSE MARTELL\nNymeria, the warrior queen of the Rhoyne, brought her ten thousand ships \nto land in Dorne, the southernmost of the Seven Kingdoms, and took Lord \nMors Martell to husband.

Learning: An In-Depth Exploration**\r\n\r\nMachine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. This revolutionary field has transformed industries, empowering applications ranging from personalized recommendations to autonomous vehicles. Below, we delve into the foundational concepts, techniques, applications, challenges, and future trends of machine learning.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **1. What is Machine Learning?**\r\n\r\nMachine learning is a scientific discipline focused on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn patterns and make decisions based on data. It operates on the premise that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions with minimal human intervention.\r\n\r\nThe concept was first proposed by Arthur Samuel in 1959, who described ML as the ability of a machine to improve its performance on a task through experience.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **2. Types of Machine Learning**\r\n\r\nMachine learning is typically categorized into three main types:\r\n\r\n#### **a. Supervised Learning**\r\nIn supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where each input is paired with the correct output. The model learns to map inputs to the desired outputs.\r\n\r\n- **Example Tasks:** Regression and classification\r\n- **Applications:** Spam email detection, image recognition, and sales forecasting\r\n- **Popular Algorithms:** Linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks\r\n\r\n#### **b. Unsupervised Learning**\r\nUnsupervised learning involves working with unlabeled data. The model identifies patterns and structures within the data without explicit guidance.\r\n\r\n- **Example Tasks:** Clustering and dimensionality reduction\r\n- **Applications:** Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems\r\n- **Popular Algorithms:** K-means clustering, DBSCAN, and PCA (Principal Component Analysis)\r\n\r\n#### **c. Reinforcement Learning**\r\nReinforcement learning is a feedback-driven approach where an agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.\r\n\r\n- **Example Tasks:** Policy optimization and decision-making\r\n- **Applications:** Game AI, robotic control, and autonomous vehicles\r\n- **Popular Algorithms:** Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and Policy Gradient Methods\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **3. Key Components of Machine Learning**\r\n\r\nTo understand machine learning, it\u2019s essential to grasp the key components that underpin the field:\r\n\r\n#### **a. Data**\r\nData is the backbone of ML. High-quality, diverse, and representative data are essential for building robust models. Data is often divided into:\r\n- **Training Set:** Used to train the model\r\n- **Validation Set:** Used to fine-tune hyperparameters\r\n- **Test Set:** Used to evaluate the model\u2019s performance\r\n\r\n#### **b. Features**\r\nFeatures are the input variables used by the model. Feature engineering\u2014the process of selecting, transforming, and creating features\u2014plays a critical role in improving model performance.\r\n\r\n#### **c. Algorithms**\r\nAlgorithms are the mathematical models or rules used by ML systems to learn from data. The choice of algorithm depends on the nature of the problem and the data.\r\n\r\n#### **d. Model**\r\nAn ML model is the output of an algorithm trained on data. It represents the learned patterns and is used to make predictions.\r\n\r\n#### **e. Evaluation Metrics**\r\nMetrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error (MSE) are used to evaluate the model\u2019s performance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **4. Steps in the Machine Learning Workflow**\r\n\r\nThe machine learning process generally follows these steps:\r\n\r\n#### **Step 1: Problem Definition**\r\nClearly define the problem and the objective.
